consider the series where vieta's formula is applied over and over again
1) a b
3) a+b ab
5) a+b+ab (a+b)ab

>_
start with 3 and 4
> 3 4
> 7 12
> 19 84
> 103 1596

The first line isn't intersting. The second line is Nanjolno birthday: 7/12. The 3rd line is Nanjolno birthyear 1984 with it being seperated by century and year. The 4th line has 1596. 
If you subtract then you get 1596-1-0-3 = 1592. Infact, I named my instagram accounts because of that @menjolno3.4_7.12_1984_1596 @menjolno1596_1_0_3z1592 with z being made to look like an equal sign.
During the time I created thoose accounts, there are no other users with menjolno to start their name. And only one user @fubiki.menjolno has it as a substring. It is still the same at april 8 2024.

1592=3184/2
3183 already has a off by one error which is with 3193 (source: youtube video ID FadmpAZTH_M “FadmpAZTH_M”  STXFadmpAZTH_M\0 STXFadmpAZTH_M\n \tFadmpAZTH_M\t)
3184 would be significant as it is also off by one of 3183
3183 is a class that I am taking currently in University (сайт: https://web.archive.org/web/20240331095205/http://www.catalog.msstate.edu/search/?P=CSE%203183)


The card that I win in a LLSIF in game lottery was #2591 (which is 1592 but the outer digits are swtiched) which is Nanjolno and Soramaru card. 
I choose to put all my tickets on it because of mathematical coincidences.
This was in my senior year in a boarding school. I remember that I choose room 310 but got 307. The reason for 310 was that junior year, I was 308. 
I wanted to average 309 which is my birthday (March 9). But I end up getting 307. I start to wonder if there was a connection between the lottery and my dorm room.
I check with online calculator that 307 is prime and that 310 is 10 times a prime. I thought back to last lottery that I failed. I remember what the card is.
I researched and the Nanjolno card that I failed to get was 370 which is also 10 times a prime. I searched the Nanjolno cards avallible in the lotter.
The only card that was a prime number is #2591 , so I bet all on it.

In the last 2 stories: 
31 is in 3183 and 3184. 
31 is in 310. 37 is in 370 and 307. 
However in the 1st story, 37 would also be there. The class that was the same level on the opposite branch in CSE (2383, 3183, 4733, 4743  and  2813, 3724, 4714, 4723) that I took last semister was 3724.
I also just realize that not only 3724 and 3183 are connect in the 1st 2 digits, but also that 24 in 3724 is 3183 where 8 multiplies 3. I accidentally ended the .md file on 37th line. andstory ended in 31st line
