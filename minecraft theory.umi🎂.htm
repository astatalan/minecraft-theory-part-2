## incompatible</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
In the beginning there was a neutron star in the universe which is
the surface of a hypersphere. The beams were bent by the hypersphere
to create a fake sun and moon back on the surface of the neutron
star. The beams were different because of wave interference with each
other. The moon light is mostly made of high frequency light, so it
is able to penetrate and give everything properties within 256 blocks
of ordinary matter. The sunlight is mostly made of infrared, visible
and ultraviolet light, which is much less penetrating. However, the
magnetic field from the neutron star blocking the radiation is still
so strong that almost nothing can detect the day and night cycle. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The universe starts to expand while being steady state for the
neutron star. This made the neutron star bigger really fast. The
neutron star collapse creating a singularity in the middle. It left 2
outer shells of neutronium behind. The 2 shells interacted with
modified gravity to stay the gravitationally stable. Since modified
gravity does not follow newton's shell theorum, the inner shell split
into a lower shell and a middle shell due to different gravitation
interaction with the upper shell. The lower and middle shell was the
nether and the upper shell was the overworld. The nether was filled
with holes because of the gravitational reaction while the overworld
had no holes. The universe is still expanding which alters the wave
interference between the sunlight and moonlight causing the moon
cycle.  The magnetic field is still blocking most of the light
because of light lag. The magnetic field gives out its own radiation
which is like sunlight but harmless.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Because everything else did not expand with accordance to its own
energy density, the neutron star became the largest object in the
universe pulling everything including intelligent life from far away
towards it. Any matter that wish to survive without falling into the
singularity would have to be able to teleport on to the surface of
the 3 shells of neutronium. The first creatures to inhabit the
minecraft world were endermen. It was because they were able to
survive the fall down from the event horizon to the overworld by
teleportation. So, it was natrual selection that created
teleportation and endermen. All other items that fell through were
going so fast, that their radiation length were really long. This
means that they reacted very little when they fall through. The light
that beams down from the sky were so blue shifted that they produced
matter pairs which could interact with the world's magnetic field.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
When the endermen's ancestors were trying to evolve teleportation.
Some ancestors had already detect the gravity, so they were able to
know the problem. They solved it while still falling to the minecraft
world.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
After landing on the overworld, the endermen used nether reactor core
to teleport to the nether. The nether had almost nothing but some
pieces of neutronium. Some endermen drop down the nether with
neutronium to place it randomly. A few pieces were placed in the
correct spot to form the main end island. There was a place
(different from the main end island) in the internether void where
endermen could teleport over and over again to the same spot making
it seem that they have anti-gravity. The endermen use teleportation
to pull matter from the singularity. Because of the no hair theorem,
the matter is always the same being endstone. The endermen and the
endstone made up the outer end islands. Outer was only in perspective
of the main end islands only after the main end island connects to
it. There were no radial gaps in the outer end islands and there were
no center.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Void is a pun. All portals teleport to the singularity. They just
differ in the where it is teleported out of the singularity. Since
the output is the same place as input then it is void because default
answer is the same place. This also makes end island also a void
portal since the definition of default changed from the place of
transportation to the place of the original portal. The default place
could also mean staying in the singularity which means that the
object is destroyed. The void portals lit with a bedrock frame would
produce a portal that does just that.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Because the speed of light is finite, the neutron star's magnetic
field was still strong. It blocks the matter pairs that were produced
from light. The magnetic field was so strong that it produced an
aurora that outshines all the light in the sky. Therefore, the sky
looks like it was always sunny. Since the magnetic field blocks the
particles, none of the particles would affect the surface like the
day and night cycle.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
As the time passed, the neutronium decayed into bedrock. The bedrock
decayed into stone in the overworld and netherrack in the end. The
endermen made glassware and quartz from the stone. Endermen were able
to use glassware to observe the stars through the blinding aurora.
The most important discovery that the endermen made were about noble
gases. Like in real life, the process were all the same except for
helium because there are no petroleum reserves in minecraft. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The starlight that was observed by endermen was still the same light
that was close to the nuetron star right before the steady state
expansion. The minecraft crust used antigravity to prevent the
starlight that was close to neutron star surface from blueshifting.
But the antigravity only fully reverses the light's blueshift, if it
originated close to the surface.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Helium that was observed by the endermen has an average mass of 3 in
minecraft. The endermen named helium as helion because it followed
the -on ending for noble gases. (helion in english means a helium
isotope that weighs 3) Helion was observed on the ground only as a
decay product of tritium, but it was only observed in the stars. The
sky was always bright. (helium in english means "sun") The
endermen think of bright things as closer to holy than the dark
things, so the endermen thought the stars were holy. Some endermen
think the stars are angels hanging around above the transparent
firmament. Endermen conclude that tritium and helion were the same
element because the mass was the same. Endermen name tritium to
something similar to trinity because it was glowing and can make
glowing water. Since tritium was really rare, endermen never were
able to collect much of it. Endermen thought if they get a bulk
amount of helium, they would be able to make something powerful like
an angel. Endermen believed in fusion, but it was from hydrogen to
deuterium to tritium, and elements with mass of 4 to 6 were skipped.
Endermen named deuterium because when endermen first discovered it,
they didn't realize that it was diatomic. So endermen measured a
value of 4 which the endermen named it after the 4th book of the
bible which is actually the 5th book of the bible.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Neon in minecraft has an average mass of 21. It was first discovered
in the atmosphere. (neon in english means "new") After it
was already named, the endermen discovered it in supernova and in the
stars before they went supernova. Since the endermen forgot why neon
was named neon, the endermen thought neon means that it was a new
star forming instead of a star dying. Because the neutron star
remnant is more positive in absolute brightness, it was actually a
star disappearing from the endermen's view. Neonite was impossible to
exist because all elements with 20-22 mass other than neon are very
radioactive. Sometimes, the endermen observed a star with large
amounts of neon which was much more proportions than even supernovas.
The endermen believed that it was an important stars because neon was
the element of new. They observed that the star also had lots of
oxygen and another element, that the endermen say "OMG".
Because oxygen was already named as O, the endermen named the new
element symbol as mg. Endermen didn't known whether or not the nuclei
weighed the same as neon, but the name "neonite" caught on
regardless.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Argon has an average mass of 36 on the minecraft world, but it has an
average mass of 40 in minecraft. Argon was also discovered in
supernova, but not as much. It wasn't named yet. The argon in
supernova remnant was discovered to weigh 36, but on the minecraft
world, it weighed 40. The endermen thought it was just 2 different
elements. The endermen decided that the reason for the similarity in
emission spectrum was because the elements were so inert that it was
hard to tell the difference using chemical reactions, so it was named
as inert. (argon in english means "inert") Many endermen
believed that the existence of 2 different inert elements is a God
given analogy which shows that even the most righteous, pure, clean,
holy, .... earthly thing is no match for the righteous, pure, clean,
holy, .... thing in heaven. The worldly argon weighs 40 which is not
as interesting as the number 36. "Jesus fasted for 40 days, but
in heaven, he would have fasted for 3 consecutive periods of 12 days"
the endermen reasoned. Although the endermen did known about
potassium, the endermen didn't know of a argonite because the
potassium-40 was too rare to discover. (most argon-40 comes from
potassium-40 decay) Potassium's molecular mass was measured to be 39.
Coincidentally, the endermen named argon-40 as Kalium with a symbol
of K. (kalium is an old name for potassium and K is the symbol for
potassium) It is a coincidence because the isotope of argon that was
named was the one that originates from potassium-40. K in reference
to krypton and kryptonite (both words start with K in english) which
one type is in space, but the other on the minecraft world. Kalium
was used as a name to make a reference to calcium (kalium and calcium
sounds the same in english) which is the element kryptonite is known
to replace. Even more coincidental is that calcium has a stable
isobar at 40. The endermen refused to name argon-40 as argonite
because the -ite ending is reserved for naming an allotroph.
Potassium has a symbol of Pp. The endermen does not know it, but (in
english word p o t a s s i u m) every 2 letter combination is already
taken up in potassium. Po is polonium. Pt is platinum. Pa is
saturnium. Ps is positronium. Pi is pionium. Pu is plutonium. Pm is
promethium.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Krypton and strontium both have an average mass of 84 in minecraft.
Krypton was also discovered in supernova, but was not discovered
before the star went supernova. Low mass stars are too dim for the
endermen to detect. The endermen named it as if it was hidden inside
the star before it went supernova, so they named it as krypton.
(krypton in english means "hidden")</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Strontium weighed the same as krypton, but was not discovered in the
sky because low mass stars are too dim to see with telescope. The
endermen thought strontium was a different type of krypton. The
spectrum was different, but the endermen reasoned it was just
different allotrophes. So, the endermen called strontium as
kryptonite. (kryptonite in english means "something that makes
superman weak") The ending part of the word to reference that
the type of krypton was solid. The endermen observed that when they
eat kryptonite, their brains work slower and they became weaker. The
endermen interpret the effects as surrendering oneself to God. (with
a capital G in english) Kryptonite replaces calcium in neurons and
muscle fibers. Since kryptonite has a higher molecular mass than
calcium, it moves slower which slows the recharge rate of neurons and
muscle fibers.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Calcium-40 and titanium-48 are no longer stable and scandium-44 is
stable. Calcium-40 decays quickly to potassium-40 which then takes
billions of years to decay to argon. However, it would do it much
quicker at high pressures because of electron capture. Alpha process
no longer produce calcium-44 because scandium-44 ends the decay chain
prematurely. The most abundant form of calcium is calcium-48. The
endermen think that 48 is a reference to 84 that tells them to intake
kryptonite. (48 and 84 are palindrome pairs) Because calcium-48 has
so many neutrons, it is no longer the least dense alkaline earth
metal. Neonite is the least dense alkali metal and of all waterproof
metals.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Lithium weighed 7 in minecraft. Lithium is the lightest metal of all
metals. Like kryptonite, the endermen could only find it on earth.
Unlike kryptonite, the endermen believed that lithium was a
completely new element. Many endermen liked lithium because it calms
them down and that 7 is a holy number. Endermen believed the calming
experience is the effect of connecting to a higher reality. In fact
it really is because the more you wither from lithium poisoning, the
closer you are to heaven. Doubly in fact, the angel that would
deliver the lithium to you is the fallen angel.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Carbon had an average weight of 12 which had the same color as
endermen's skin. Endermen really liked their skin color because 12 is
a holy number</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Xenon had an average weight of 127. Xenon was only discovered in
supernova that came from neutron stars which the endermen called
"blinking stars". The endermen thought the blinking stars
are strange. And that out of all the elements found on the minecraft
world, only xenon was discovered to be nowhere other than from
blinking stars which was also strange. So, it was named as strange.
(xenon in english means "strange") Although xenon was never
isolated in minecraft due to endermen's technological limitation, the
endermen believed that they still have xenon. It was actually iodine.
The spectrum were a little different but it was still purple.
Endermen dismiss the inconsistency thinking that xenon was just a
strange element. Endermen never named a xenonite because the endermen
thought that both the worldly xenon and celestial xenon had the same
chemical properties other than spectrum.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Iron was already named, but the endermen did not know why it was
named that. (iron in english means "holy") When the
endermen discovered the supernova, they found so much nickel which
was an element that is never discovered on the minecraft world. The
nickel had a half-life of 6 days which decays to cobalt that had 77
days of half-life until it turns into iron. (both nickel and cobalt
in english means "devil") Both 77 and 83 (half-life of
nickel plus cobalt or approximately equal to bateman effective
half-life) are significant to the endermen. The 77th year of the
centuary was the year before the endermen government oppressed
enderman using Public Law 95-225. The 83rd year of the centuary was
the year before the book 1984 was suppose to happen. The endermen
concludes that since iron is holy, then nickel and cobalt also
relates. They were 3 elements which made the endermen think that it
is like the trinity as in the 3 crosses. So the endermen named the 2
other metals as nickel and cobalt because the 2 others on the cross
were not Jesus. Another reason why the endermen thought they were
related to Jesus was that on average, nickel decayed on the 7th day,
and then stay as cobalt for 11 periods of 7 days, and then finally
turn into iron. In total, there were 12 periods of 7 days. 1 as
nickel which represent the criminal on the cross that criticized
Jesus. the endermen compared him to Judas just like there were 1
Judas and 11 other disciples. Because Judas sold Jesus for money,
nickel's symbol was the smile instead of the star. (nickel sounds
like nico yazawa which has the symbol of a smile) The smile
represents the obverse on the coin. Stable nickel from the stellar
alpha process was observed to be mass of 60. The endermen believed
that stable nickel was a different element than nickel. It was just
trying disguise itself like iron just like Judas being a fake
disciple, according to the endermen. The endermen could not observe
the zinc's decay chain because the half-life was so small. The
endermen concluded that 60 represents the number of smiles on 30
shekels of silver which judas got for selling jesus. Each shekel had
a smile on each side (instead of only on the obverse side) because
the shekels were extra greedy. Endermen collected lots of data. It
took a lot of data to determine the molecular mass of elements that
make small proportions of the supernova remnant. One of the elements
was manganese. It had a mass of 55 which was so close to 56 which
made the endermen say "OMG" so the endermen named it after
mg. It wasn't named after om because that was not an existing element
that the endermen named.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Endermen also discovered stable cobalt which had a mass of 59. The
endermen predict that there also exist a second stable nickel with a
mass of 62 because arithmetic progression of 3 makes sense since
iron, cobalt, and nickel were already related to the trinity.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Endermen considered there to be 7 sacred elements. The first is iron
which is due to its own name. The next 3 are helium, lithium, and
carbon because they correspond to 3, 7, and 12. The endermen believed
that the 3 numbers are the most holy of all numbers because endermen
are christians. The next 3 are neon, argon, and krypton because they
correspond to products of 3, 7, and 12 which are 21, 36, and 84.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
As endermen practiced their new beliefs, the endermen stopped leaving
skeletons when they died. This is because that kryptonite replaces
the calcium in their bones. Kryptonite is a bigger ion which makes it
more water soluble which causes the skeleton to decay too quickly.
Endermen stored their dead in the nether because nether was spacious
without many important stuff. The nether heat destroys skeletons even
faster. The kryptonite (which leaked out of decaying endermen
skeletons) combined with aluminum oxide and europium to make
glowstone which makes clumps of glowstone everywhere in the nether.
(glowstone glows green in real life like kryptonite in superman
movies) Europium doesn't glow by itself, so the endermen who believed
in God but not Jesus were named after them. (еврейский and
европий<span lang="ru-RU"> </span>are similar in pronunciation
<span lang="ru-RU">по-ру</span><span lang="ru-RU">с</span><span lang="ru-RU">ский</span>)
Glowstone glows by absorbing uv light. The uv light comes from high
energy neutrinos collisions.</p>

Endermen had all the same color eyes which were green, but they
differ in color when their eyes blinked. The endermen debated what
color the eye blinks should be. Some endermen believed that it should
be red because the emission spectrum of lithium is red, and 7 and 12
are numbers that are alike which 7 corresponds to lithium and 12
corresponds to carbon. However some endermen believe that a blink is
best expressed with xenon because xenon is the element from the
blinking star. Another reason to choose xenon was that it had both 7
and 12 as digits of the atomic mass. Xenon was more convincing that
lithium, so the endermen use eugenics to make their eye blinks to be
purple color. Iodine which the endermen called 'worldly xenon' was a
bit pinkish. Xenon was a bit bluish. The endermen choose the average
which was a deep purple. Since the endermen picked iodine and xenon
as the color of their blinks, endermen gave iodine and xenon the
symbol of an eye. (in english, the letter 'I' that is used as the
symbol for iodine is pronounced the same as eye) In order to enforce
the eugenics program, when an endermen look at another endermen, they
had to blink. Blinking shows that the endermen has purple blinks. If
the endermen or thing that looks like an endermen (this includes the
player) does not blink purple, the endermen would get made and
attack.</p>

Endermen lived long and fullfilling lives. As the time went on, more
stone was used. Some stones had more dead endermen than others. The
endermen flesh decayed into the stone which gave it properties like
soul sand. Endermen flesh were everywhere, so even the small stones
in the overworld floated on water.</p>

###### Chromium doesn't have any part in the minecraft theory other
than being a byproduct of the alpha process. Calcium-53 has 20
protons (age of me in year 114) and 33 neutrons (age of sumipe in
year 114). Calcium-53 decays into chromium-53. One reason why the
endermen may have named it chromium was that they discovered 2
elements (isobars) with the same emission spectrum, so they named it
based on color. Back in feburary 11, 2024, I wrote on twitter
comparing chromium to marriage. The reason was that chromium to me
means something hard, so I thought hard means diamond which is
diamond ring. I had overlooked the fact that chromium is what gives
rubies their color, and rubies were the symbol of marriage rings
before diamonds replaced them because of advertisements. How to find
if you and your partner of compatible? Take the smaller age and that
is the number of protons, then take the larger age and that is the
number of neutrons, see if the atom decays into chromium. Another
reason why sumipe should marry me is that rubies are also made of
aluminum and aluminum's symbol is al which rubies are transparent and
transparent aluminum is alon which sounds like Alan which is my name.
In the year 114, I would turn 21 before sumipe turn 34. And that also
decays into chromium. Even worse is that its mass is twice of
aluminum which mean that it may be a even more 2 weeks. 2 times a
aluminum nuclei is iron-54 which is the only iron isobar that has the
same isobar as chromium. In my twitter I wrote that iron decaying
into chromium is analogy that marriage is only half-way. However a
counter argument is that 20 and 33 can concatenate to 2033 which is
in the near future. Another thing that can cause another 2 weeks is
that in the year 114, sumipe will turn 34 like in rule 34. Another
thing is that scandium-55 decays into both chromium and manganese.
Manganese as in it is the average of chromium-54 and iron-56 which
means that both marriage and marriage which means more 2 weeks. Back
in 2022, I thought it would be me and nanjolno because when nanjolno
is 39, I would be 19, and 1939 is a pretty number. 2033 is 2 weeks
away from 1939.</p>

###### Why Sumipe and chromium? Because sumipe voiced kuromu (

if sumipe married nanjolno when civil union first existed in japan
(11.5.2014), nanjolno would be 22 and sumipe would be 30 which 22p
30n on ( https://periodictable.com/Isotopes/022.52/index.html )
decays with 100% to the most common chromium isotope. Chromium-52 is
also the isotope in the stellar alpha process which I wrote on
twitter @DoNutDecember feburary 11, 2024 that iron-52 decaying to
chromium-52 symbolize that marriage is halfway. 11.5.2014 is
important date because it's 9th anniversary is the arithmetic
progression of my and nanjolno's birthdays. 11.5.2014 is also
important because benjamin netanyahu and sara netannyahu were 65 and
56 which are palindrome paired. 56 is next in the alpha process.
benjamin netanyahu 's birthday is eli ayase birthday (bibi member)
which is also the date if you add my birthday to nanjolno birthday
(3+7=10(9+12=21)). Coincidentally, sara netanyahu birthday is the
arithmetic progression of my birthday and nanjolno birthday. Rubidium
is same etymology as ruby which is made of chromium. Rb87 isotone is
same isobar as Cr48.</p>

Endermen discovered that nitrogen was 2 different masses. One is 14
and a smaller portion is 15. The endermen Decides to name them light
nitrogen and heavy nitrogen. Since nitrogen was already thought of
being 14, the light nitrogen's name did not change. Heavy nitrogen
was given the symbol of Nh. (N stands for nitrogen. "h"
stands for heavy in english) Endermen believed nitrogen is like
lithium. They were accidentally right because nitrogen is the 7th
element and lithium weighed 7. Nitrogen asphyxiation was harder to
detect. When there is too much nitrogen, not only would you get the
same numbing effect like lithium and wither, but also you wouldn't
know that you were drowning, so the bubbles were whited out on the
player ui. Another coincidence is that lithium magnesium alloy is the
lightest waterproof alloy. Magnesium is the 12th element which
coincide with 7.</p>

###### The endermen could not agree on which type of copper to call
copper. Copper was discovered to be a weight of 64 and was given a
symbol of Cu. Then copper was isolated to light copper and heavy
copper. Light copper was a little more abundant than heavy copper by
69/31. Endermen couldn't decide what the element symbols should be.
Cu is already 2 letters, so they cannot just add another symbol. Some
endermen found that the square root of 64 is 8 and 8th mv in fripside
infinite clips is sister's noise. The sisters referenced in the song
both had copper colored hair. The younger sister had a slightly
lighter color hair than the older sister. Light copper and heavy
copper are like sisters. Cube root is 4 and 4th mv has 2 girls and
the one that is not nanjolno has copper colored hair. 2 is the 6th
root and in the 2nd mv, Nanjou Yoshino has copper colored hair. Some
endermen believed that light copper's symbol should be Sk which
stands for Shirai Kuroko and heavy copper's symbol should be Mm which
stands for Misaka Mikoto. The endermen believed that the size of the
characters should correspond to the weight of the element. Other
endermen pointed out that Misaka Mikoto had 20000 clones and that the
number of characters should correspond to the abundance of the
elements. The copper ore didn't exist because it was still debated
which copper should it be. The split of 69/31 caused 69 to be a
symbol of sex because Shirai Kuroko is gay with Misaka Mikoto.
Furthermore, Shirai Kuroko is the more gay character which
corresponds to the element with abundance 69. The endermen made candy
named after sk which is skittles.  The hard, sweet, and addictiveness
is like gluciuum and lithium. The endermen wanted to be like lithium
and gluciuum because 7 times 9 is 63. M 'n m are named after Mm. The
endermen thought element with mass of 13 would be something like
carbon, so the endermen made it look black. And 5 might be no stable
nuclei but pleasant like "Heaven is a Place on Earth". So
the M 'n m is designed to be black and melts quickly.</p>

Before an endermen died, he thought that life was so nice that he
would always cherish the memories in heaven. Every endermen on his
deathbed would talk about how grateful he was in life and it just
keeps going on. The endermen's children would think that heaven would
be much more better than life on the minecraft world. The endermens'
souls ascended. The endermen were too right, heaven was too good. The
endermens' souls couldn't believe that they were tricked to continue
living a life so much worse than what they could have lived in
heaven. Nostalgia for their children faded away. The endermen wanted
to avenge for the time that they lost form not going to heaven
earlier. But first, they are just souls in soul sand and need a
weapon. They choose the alloy with the most specific strength. It was
lithium magnesium (endermen called magnesium as neonite) alloy, and
by weight, it was stronger than any nitinol, high entropy alloy,
steel, titanium alloy, aluminium-scandium alloy, maraging steel,
ferroalloy, tungsten alloy and others. It was the strongest metal
that is stable in stp. The high lithium content made it less dense
than water. The magnesium content was just high enough to not react
with water and be stiff. The armour was perfected with the exception
of isotope separation. It could have weighed a little less if it was
made from lithium-6 and magnesium-24 instead of lithium-7 and
magnesium-25. Although beryllium alloies are usually stronger than
magnesium alloies, beryllium cannot be alloied with lithium because
the intermetallic is unstable which eliminates the possiblility of
beryllium having a stronger alloy than lithium magnesium. The wither
skulls were also made of lithium. When it hits, the skull explodes
spreading lithium dust. The dust is hygroscopic and get absorbed into
the blood after displacing hydrogen. The lithium calms and numbs the
victim preventing the victim from knowing how much damage they took,
only able to know that they are taking damage. It is the same feeling
like when you trying to count the red tiny hearts from the black
hearts. The displacement of hydrogen causes damage like poison. Blue
skulls were blue because they contain magic that irradiates UV
catastrophe. Massive numbers of endermen souls gathered around ready
to reenter minecraft. The endermen souls knew that the wither cannot
teleport or even teleport to the same place because the temptation to
return to heaven is so strong that all the teleportation would be
redirected back into heaven. Since there were few soul sand in the
overworld, no withers were able to spawn there. The withers spawned
all at once evenly distributed in every chunk of the nether. They
quickly defeated all the endermen civilization in the nether. They
flew out through the top holes going to the overworld. They tried to
destroy the bedrock but it was only enough damage to imprint their
face into each block of bedrock. The face imprinting cause a build up
of cracks in the middle which created the borders of the modern
bedrock block to be in the middle of the wither face.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
After all the withers left to attack the overworld, the endermen were
safely able to go back to the nether. The endermen concluded that it
was the burial practices that made the withers. Endermen cleaned up
the mess in the nether and piled the soul sand in clumps so that any
new wither attacks would be localized. The endermen trained
themselves to bury themselves into ender pearls. The endermen didn't
like water because it causes them to decay a bit, and the endermen
think that it might cause more soul sand to form. The endermen
designed the ender pearl to trap the souls which also traps the souls
from going to heaven. All endermen that turned into enderpearls would
live in boredom because they were forever stuck in the same place.
Ender pearls cannot blink because they are already dead, so the eye
of ender are always greenish-blue, and ender pearls are darker on the
inside. The blue from the ender pearl and eye of ender is from the uv
catastrophe radiation. Since souls and stuff are magic, they are not
quantum which causes them to emit uv catastrophe. Since no more
endermen bury themselves outside of the enderpearl, no more soul sand
were created. The sand and gravel in the overworld began to seperate
from the endermen souls since no new endermen souls were replinishing
them. They became less like soul sand and were able to sink in water
and lava.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The endermen looked up into the nether-overworld void. They saw it
was bright. They measured the emission spectrum and it matched
lithium and neonite. The endermen interpreted it as a sign of a 2nd
heaven existing in between the overworld and nether. So, the endermen
named the minecraft world on top as overworld. The name means that it
was over something. The 2nd heaven was interpreted as something much
more significant than the 1st heaven. The lithium which was suppose
to only be found on the ground was interpreted as endermen on the
ground can even ascend to heaven. The neonite was interpreted as
something that is new. Therefore, it should be named the 2nd heaven.
The endermen labeled it as an achievement but with a question mark.
It is like a happening but more like a sign. The achievement was
called "Beginning?"</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Some withers died from friendly fire and dropped wither stars. The
wither stars contained lithium and neonite. This proved that it was
infact lithium and neonite. So the endermen made the achievement to
be about a happening which was "Beginning." The endermen
were able to measure the molecular mass of neonite for the 1st time.
It was 25. Since the mass of neonite, 25, is different than the mass
of neon, 21, it was supposed to be renamed, but the name had stayed
for too long for the endermen to want to change it. The endermen also
found that the item could not teleport or else it disappears. The
endermen thought that it was like a star because stars get eaten by
singularities and teleportation goes through singularities. So the
endermen called it as nether star. There were still some withers
around the bedrock surface of the nether, so the endermen were not
able to reach far up toward the 2nd heaven. Endermen decided to name
the 2nd heaven. They named it as "eastern capital". East
was used because east means new sun. New describes both the light and
neonite. They use japanese so it is <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京</span></font></font>.
The weight of 25 made endermen like the name for the element weighing
55. The endermen know that 5(5) is Mg and 55 is Mn. A coincidence
that endermen could not discover is that Magnesium has a weight of 25
and the 25th element is Manganese. Endermen did give neonite a
scientific name which is derived from "my God" part of OMG.
God is great and great in latin is magnus, so the endermen named it
as magnesium. Since magnesium is connected to God, lithium-magnesium
alloy means that God is returning to earth. Which is a big happening.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The endermen mix the nether star with oxygen, silicon, and iron
because they thought the 3 inner layers of a star that is about to
become a supernova to be holy. It makes a beacon. The beacon's side
that face the iron core was made of obsidian because it has more iron
than glass. The beacon was put on a pile of iron and it emit a beam.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
###### A coincidence with neonite and lithium is that in real life
the highest specific strength would be neon and lithium alloy. Like
lithium and neonite being 7 and 25, lithium and neon have a isotope
with molar mass of 7 and 22. Neon turns metallic at high pressures.
Lithium has already been experimented in real life to alloy with
metallic hydrogen. Lithium stabilize metallic hydrogen at lower
pressures, so it is likely to do that with other metallic nonmetals.
Stabilize probably also means that it increase in strength. Lithium
etymology also coincide because lithium means earth which is were stp
is and lower pressures from metallic hydrogen is more like stp.
Another etymology coincidence is Lithium and Neon becomes LiNe which
is line. Lines are strong because they can carry weight with a low
cross section. I don't think there are other elements or mixtures
that are like that because more elements means less pure which
correlates to being a weaker alloy. And, heavier nuclei means more
molar mass which means less bonds per mass. Metallic hydrogen is
predicted to be more specific strength than any materials that are
stable in stp. It is likely that atoms that are more electronegative
have more molar strength in metallic state. Neon is the most
electronegative. Neon has a bigger atomic radius allowing it to
interact with more atoms and field strength to decrease less over
distance which makes metallic neon to be the strongest and most
specific strength pure metallic nonmetal. Things with higher specific
strength are atoms with lower molar mass. antimuonium hydride has
properties similar to helium which means that metallic neon would
have to be 20 times stronger than antimuonium hydride to beat
antimuonium hydride. There are other fermions but they are too heavy
to be considered. There are antimatter and matter pairs, but they are
unlikely to be strong as their counterparts because they need to not
hit each other. There are neutronium, nuclear pasta, quark gluon
plasma, electron degenerate matter, glueball, and other high energy
materials, but they depend on interactions at a short distance which
makes their specific strength really weak even though they have high
strength. Although the interactions in the high energy materials use
very fast and massive particles, it is only active support
implementation of it that could use the theoretical specific strength
because each of the particles can bond to another around them which
doesn't help confine them to a shape. If counting active support,
light would have the highest specific strength. Therefore, metallic
neon lithium alloy would be the most specific strength material
possible.</p>

The heat produced from the endless barrage of wither skull began to
lit a void between the overworld and nether which then began to lit
the a void below the nether. The bedrock and space between the nether
and overworld and below the overworld was turned into lava as an
intermediate step to creating the void. All the withers disappeared
because they cannot survive teleportation. It all happened on July
22. The endermen reasoned that July meaning 7 which is the lithium.
22 is the day after 21 which 21 is neon. Therefore, the date that it
happened means that it was after neon. 22 is not associated with a
mass of any element because endermen have not detected neon 22.

</span></font></font>and <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">きみを探しに</span></font></font>,
Nanjou Yoshino derived 3650 from the 7th and 25th indices of
2020.04.01 - fripSide infinite video clips. 7th mv is "decade"
and 25th mv is "only my railgun-version 2020-". 2020 and
decade are both decades. <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">君が笑む夕暮れ
</span></font></font>is about the sunset which all the stars in  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京
</span></font></font>did, and smile referencing to nickel-60. 
<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">あなたの愛した世界

</span></font></font>described the stars in  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京
</span></font></font>because it is starlight and twilight is when it
is not sunny nor black like the night sky.  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">きみを探しに
</span></font></font>is what the endermen does when  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京
</span></font></font>turned into lava. A special song was named from
the mass of lithium and neonite to mourn the loss. It was named
"7<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">月</span></font></font>25<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">日</span></font></font>".
Infact, if you defeat a wither above the build height limit while you
are also above the build height, you get a disk containing 7<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">月</span></font></font>25<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">日</span></font></font>,
but it doesn't work because the song is copyrighted. The lyrics was
like "dog died and get 2 cats". The endermen mourned as if
their dog died. The endermen were angry. "It must be element
22's fault" they thought because it happened on july 22. Then a
white floating cube in the overworld was making cat (coincidentally)
sounds. It appeared on the same day, so endermen believed that the
ghast was the culprit. The endermen thought "it must be made of
element 22" They were accidentally correct. The ghast was white
like titanium dioxide. The endermen thought "if the ghast stayed
in the overworld, the ghast would cause the overworld sky to turn
into lava". It was also the 15th year of the millennial when the
events happened, the endermen interpret it as an element weighing 15
which is heavy nitrogen which also starts with N. And, 15 plus 7
(july) is 22. Since heavy nitrogen is so connected to the japanese
stuff, the endermen decides to change the name to be like japan. The
name nihonium was chosen because it is named after nihon, and it
coincidentally resembles the heavy nitrogen symbol. A coincidence
that was created because it happened on the 15th year was that in the
15th mv, the lyrics described a grey sky. The grey sky is the bedrock
sky in the nether. One coincidence that the endermen couldn't know
about is that 14 and 15 are the mass of the 7th element (because
endermen count elements by mass and not protons) and 14th and 15th mv
of fripside infinite clips are in fripside's 12th single.<span lang="en-US">
The coincidence is also notable because the 12th single is the only
single that contains 2 mv. Beside 7 and 12, another coincidence is
that the single name "white forces" describes nitrogen.</span><span lang="en-US">
</span><span lang="en-US">It is plural because nitrogen is diatomic.
</span>July 22 was also pi day and pi is circle which means Judas's
religion, and coins are very circular too. Smiles are on coins. The
endermen decides to personify the day. They need to name it from a
person that means smile in japanese and the last name needs to
contain <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">澤
</span></font></font>(the endermen always chant "drain the
swamp" when something bad happens. and, the term has its own
wikipedia page in english), so they choose <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">矢澤にこ
</span></font></font>as the name of the devil. Sora Tokui was chosen
to voice  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">矢澤にこ
</span></font></font>because what the devil did was in the sky and
was powerful. Sora means sky, and Tokui means power.  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">矢澤にこ</span></font></font>sings
<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">これからの</span></font></font>Someday

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Many endermen thought, maybe it will stop on july 25th. After july 25
passed and nothing happened, many endermen thought it will stop next
year as a reference to fortuna on the sixteenth night. Other endermen
noted that 84 minus 22 is 62 which is predicted to be a second stable
nickle, so it might stop on the 25th or 28th.

###### A coincidence that doesn't seem to be able to fit in the

magnesium which relates to manganese which is 55. 55 and 59. 5-&gt;6.
65 is the m and m copper and 69 is gallium which if you mess up the
etymology to galium, it would be milk and m and m is milk chocolate.
if use atomic number, gallium and copper are as far from each other
as iron and cobalt. Ga is 31 which double to get 62 which would be
second stable nickel which existence is implied by stable cobalt. And
55 and 59 because add to 114. And, 55th molotov bday was molotov
baskets on tokyo. 55 is magnesium but misspelled. inspired to write
from 9lDilC7nsYM&amp;lc=UgwWFHRspf9HzrqnGvx4AaABAg Also 114, because

###### Why is it called bromide? Because if it is guys then it is
gay. But why is it called gay? Because Gallium and Yttrium. Why those
2? Gallium has 2 isotopes. Gay is not natural, so don't use natural
abundance. How to counter argue against "gay is natural"?
Hypocritically say that "Well then nature is brutal and
barbaric" then cite lotr. Use assumption of equal probability
which concludes that the average nucleon is 39 nuetrons. 39 on the
periodic table is Yttrium. Therefore , it is Gallium Yttrium. Gallium
is 31 and 31 is twin prime with 29 which is copper. Copper average
neutrons is 35 which 35 is bromine. So gay girls are cubr which is a
bromide. A gay girl is cuprous. cubr has a weight ranging from 142 to
146. if equal probability, it is 144 and 44 is russia element which
explains that all russophile seiyuus are cuprous. 14441 is sumire
uesaka's myanimelist id. It has lots of 4's and 1's just like 114. In
cupric form, the average (Principle of indifference) weight would be
224 which equals 15^2-1 which 15 is the green mv like 14 is the white
mv. Gallium yttrium has an average weight of 159 which 59 is
praseodymium which means green twin like how cupric bromide would be
the green twin of cuprous bromide. Cuprous etymology is an island
just like lesbian etymology is also an island. The island may have
been named for being wooded. Wood is hard and has the same color as
copper. Cyprus also may be been named from a wood. Praseodymium is
the gayest element. Excluding all the alkaline and alkali metals,
prasodymium has the largest atomic radius. The outermost electrons
are the valence electrons. If they are poking out, that is kind of
gay. Why is it 144 and not other number ending in 44? Because the 2
elements that are named after places in russia are ruthenium at 44
and moscovium at 114, and 144 is a byte entropic average (don't know
what the term is but the answer choice closest to it would be the
most likely answer in multiple choice questions) of 44 and 114. A
reason why gay girls are cuprous and not cupric is that cuprous
bromide is white which corresponds to the 14th mv. 14 looks like 114
and 144 and 44 which are russian. Cuprous bromide has lonsdaleite
structure like netherite. Another reason why it is green twin is that
copper bromide comes in green and white form, and the cupric form is
green. Cupric bromide is soluble in water just like how men, men's
saliva, and men's fingerprints contain more water per mass than
women. Anhydrous cupric bromide is black like how Yoshino Nanjou wore
both the DDT dress and ZOMG dress in 15th mv. Only if that was a
mixed color dude or ancient debris in the bag would it have been a
camgrow ceramic. Instead it was a yellow bloon. The reason why the
pink bloon was added to the game was that pink is triggered like
snowflake when the 3rd gen game implies that there are 2 asians in a
white or black. Stable nickel and stable cobalt are group together as
devil's element. Stable nickel weighs 60 and stable cobalt weighs 59.
They are like twins just like praseodymium etymology. Some endermen
believe that there is another stable nickel which weighs 62 that is
mistaken as evil. The endermen believe that the second stable nickel
would be mistaken as a bad guy like how the good samaritan was
mistaken as a bad person by the jews. So, the hypothetical element
that weighs 62 was named samarium. (Element 62 in real life is called
samarium) Jews say that the samaritans are enemies and therefore are
not their neighbors. However, not only does jesus say that they are
neighbors, but also that samarium and europium are adjacent on the
periodic table. (еврейский and европий<span lang="ru-RU">
</span>are similar in pronunciation <span lang="ru-RU">на </span><span lang="ru-RU">ру</span><span lang="ru-RU">с</span><span lang="ru-RU">ск</span><span lang="ru-RU">ом</span>)
The smaller copper bromide compound is lesbian just like the smaller
copper isotope is shirai kuroko. Inconclusion, lesbium is copper, not
lithium. (which you would find on the internet) The smaller number is
more lesbian than the larger number. Copper 63 would have 34 which is
selenium. Moon as in mooning and moon as in nozomi symbol. Copper 65
would have 36 which is krypton. Hiding is not very lesbian. However,
muse fans (according to some unofficial poll) have voted that umi to
be the most lesbian. The reason is that since umi tries to hide it,
she is showing the most lesbian traits. Some people may think umi is
bow symbol which shoot projectiles and bullet is a projectile.
However, arrows are the opposite of bullet because bullet is made of
copper since it needs to touch the barrel a lot. arrows don't touch a
lot, so they are not made of copper.</p>

###### Having all the withers teleport back to heaven would be "The
end of summer" which is on July 22 just like how after summer
all the fun stops and people have to go back to school. If you remove
a 2, then it would be July 2. However July 2 is the end of summer if
you count that the seasons of the year following the order of spring,
summer, fall, winter with spring beginning at the start of the year.
July 2 is when busy beaven 5 was proven. When I learned of the news
on Feburary 2, all I thought of is that 5 as in when I compared
"Heaven is a Place on Earth" to 5-ary logic. It is relevant
because busy beaven 5 is as incomprehensible as the output of 5 state
2 symbol turing machine are a lot. NP problems are also described
like them. "Heaven is a Place on Earth" was released on the
237th day of the year which is 8.24 . Element with a weight of 237 is
also NP, but the p is lower case. 8 and 24 refers to the 8th and 24th
dimension sphere packing which were solved with elliptic curves. It
can abbreviated to ec which convert from hex to decimal is 236 which
is the other long living Np isotope or a long living U isotope. The
sphere packing solver was ukrainian which abbreviates to UA. The "A"
could be a placeholder like 0, so it is U, or A is alloy. U is an
element next to Np. "Heaven is a Place on Earth" capital
letters are H P E which convert from cyrillic is N P ye or yo. U
sounds like yo.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The withers teleporting back to heaven is the same reason why withers
cannot exist in the end. The wither going through end portal is a
glitch and doesn't count. The soul sand and wither skull doesn't
spawn the wither in the end because the end is where things are able
to exist in the void by constantly teleporting to the same place.
Soul sand knows that spawning the wither in the end would only make
it disappear to heaven.</p>

###### Another coincidence beside lithium metallic neon alloy being
7.22 while lithium neonite being 7.25 is that on 7.22 bedrock on the
nether roof appeared. Bedrock is the strongest material in minecraft
like lithium metallic neon alloy would be the strongest material in
real life. Lithium metallic neon alloy is only stable in extreme
conditions like how the bedrock exchange places with lava many times
over between 0.0.24 and infdev. Lava represents the idea of extreme
conditions. Void doesn't count just like how singularity doesn't
count as the strongest material in real life.</p>

###### Why is phosphorous P? because 15 and IUPAC is up. 15 as in
15th mv where nanjolno was wearing the really cool dress that was as
cool as fascism. When phosphorous was discovered, it was used in
magic tricks because the production was kept a secret and phosphorous
had really cool chemical properties. So that is the similarity.
Phosphorous is nitrogen group. Arsenic is connected to green like the
green dress in 15th mv. Antimony average weight of stable isotope
Laplace's Principle of Indifference is 122 which means 12th single
has 2 mv. Bismuth is german etymology and is white mass. White energy
is white mass times white force like white forces. Bismuth's atomic
number is 83 like in 1983-schwarzesmarken-. Bismuth symbol is Bi
which means gay and straight in english. I have made the joke "What
is Bi and turns crystals into the lgbt flag? bismuth" ever since
2020. Before I wrote about it, I hated phosphorous because it is the
element that doesn't seem to have a alternative in life but should.
Sb as symbol means b-side which the 12th single was the only phase 2
single where the b-side got a mv. The S is capitalized because “side”
in “fripSide” is capitalized but the 1st letter is not
capitalized. Therefore, if fripside were to be named an element, it
would be Sf and not Fs. Fs is already facisium which is element 87.
It is facisium because 87 in IUPAC is Os which is 78 which 1978 is
Public Law 95-225. Sb is also feminine because "lesbian" in
english contains the substring. Written before, copper is the other
lesbian element. Copper is most well known to be alloyed with Sn
which is right beside Sb. It is still a coincidence because 'N' is
opposite of 'S'. The second most well known element to be alloyed
with copper is Zn, and "Z" is just a "N" turned
on it's side. It is a coincidence because turning something is a sign
that it is negated. Moscovium because moscow is the place most
associated with fascism compared to the places that share a name with
an element. Its chemical symbol is Mc which also stands for
minecraft. Antimony etymology is not alone. Not alone like how the
14th mv is not alone because there is the 15th mv in the same single.
Many people want to believe that it means anti-monk, but that
coincidence would be absolutely boring. Sb atomic number is 51 which
reversed is 15, and reverse of 14 is 41 which is Nb which N and S are
opposites. North and south, nakamoto and satoshi. Nb number of
nuetrons is 52 (only 4 odd odd stable nuclei) which is one off of 51.
Sb number of nuetrons is 71 which skip 16 because 16th mv is not
related to csam and stuff. Why is it arsenic instead of germanium? If
germanium then bismuth would not be a coincidence. Arsenic is
masculine etymology like stibium (odd english name, works with
antimony because staying together is also feminine) is feminine
etymology. Arsenic is known for absorbing light to produce energy in
both brown algea (correlation not causation) and photovoltaic.
Although germanium and other elements are also used for photovoltaic,
there other uses overshadows photovoltaics. Why 52 neutrons? Arsenic
was compared to germanium. On the other side would be tellurium. In
world building, oxygen would bind to the main component of crust. If
the crust was made of either tellurium or germanium, the
abbreviations would be TeO and GeO, both of which means earth in
english prefixes.</p>

###### What other coincidence is there to 14441 being sumire uesaka's
myanimelist id. 12 sqaured is 144 and 21 squared is 441 which 14441
contains both substrings. However, it is not a coincidence because if
the base is sufficiently large then any polynomial coefficients would
work. Excluding trivial solutions, only (21,12) and (31,13) works in
base 10 because 3 squared is less than 10. 144 is coincidental as
written before. 441 is coincidental because the japanese regiment
that fought against imperial japan was numbered 442. The military
numbers starts with 101 and not 100, and 101 in base 21 is 442.
Therefore it is a coincidence. Sumire uesaka likes soviet union, and
soviet union was an enemy against imperial japan. What would be a
coincidence with 13 and 31? 31st mv is secret operation which
contains both phase 3 and phase 2, and 13th mv has the word "two"
in the title.</p>

seiyuus that also are like her, the other seiyuus are also known for
other stuff which would overshadow the lesbian baiting. So, I think
that sakura ayane is the most lesbian baiting. It is not known yet if
she is actually lesbian. Sakura ayane's birthday is the 29th day of
the year. Sakura ayane's initials are SA which is one off of Sb just
like how Sn is also one off. SA also coincides because it means <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">セクハラ

hydrogen. CNO cycle prevented elements heavier than oxygen from

Some humanoids tried to protect themselves by using immune system.
They are called volatile humanoids. The immune system had to use
chemicals that are more and more volatile. The volatile substances
became explosive. In order to prevent the humanoid from accidentally
exploding, the humanoid made 2 sacs for the volatiles. 1 sac is
smaller and contained very sensitive but not powerful explosive.
Another sac contained very powerful but not sensitive explosive. The
sensitive explosive is much better at complexing the strange matter.
The powerful explosive was very safe to store in large quantities.
Since it is powerful it means that it is energy dense, so it can make
multiple times the amount of the sensitive explosive. Sometimes there
is lots of red matter around, so the humanoid evolved to be made of
erectile tissue, so that the sensitive explosives can cycle many
times very fast over a really large surface area to complex any red
matter. The erectile tissue moves air instead of liquids because
liquids are heavy and biologically expensive. This makes a hissing
sound when the air is moved through small holes.  The erectile tissue
evolves to allow the sensitive explosive sac to cover the internal
organs which shortens the distance between the sac and the place of
irritation. This had a side effect of turning the sensitive explosive
sac into a implosive bomb which can pressurize the insides above
autoignition pressure. Eventually the red matter won and there is
nothing but a stupid brain. The mob is now a creeper. The side effect
became the main effect. When the creeper wants to explode, the
creeper stops to get all its muscle to work for a erections. Then a
hissing sound is made from the implosive sac traveling through air
filled tissue. The implosive sac gets around the secondary explosive
sac which needs the implosive sac to ignite. Some of the volatile
humanoid do not use lots of air and erections to get rid of red
matter. Getting rid of red matter with air and stuff is messy and the
red matter can turn from complexed to inorganic and come back to
destroy more. So the humaniod evolved to excrete waste that contains
complexed red matter into sticky white substances. It is designed to
stick and remain that way for a long time. The white sticky substance
decays slower in closed environments, so the spider evolved to have
lots of eyes to see in the dark. White sticky substances can be
disturbed when there are lots of others around, so the spider becomes
aggressive when there is no light. There isn't an evolutionary
advantage to be aggressive outside because the white sticky substance
would be quickly decaying no matter how many are around. The white
sticky substance evolved to be comfy cobwebs because the more
comfortable, the less likely it would be thrown out to decay into
inorganic red matter. The spider evolved to not fill their room with
waste so fast. So the spider becomes smaller. smaller means smaller
strides. To make up for the loss in speed, the spider evolved to have
more legs. There might be artificial lighting in the spider's room.
To get a better way to tell the difference between inside and
outside, the spider evolved a black body to detect thermal radiation
that the sun emits. Unlike what others may theorize, the reason why
spiders are neutral during the day is not because the spiders are
blinded by the sunlight.</p>

Some humanoids used another way to get rid of red matter. They are
called undead humanoids. The humaniods became undead because undead
means that some effects do the opposite effect. But red matter got
stronger and the undeadness could not make the red matter do the
opposite effect. The humaniod lost its brain and became a zombie.
Some undead humanoids can use their undeadness to negate hunger. The
undead humaniods then evolved to close off points of failure. Closing
off also eliminated lots of flesh because flesh absorbs things. The 
undead humaniods still lose the brains because the red matter was
getting so strong, and they became skeletons.</p>

The immune system complexes stuff using thiols. The thiol would react
with a metal ion and trap the metal ion inside. The exploding
humanoids evolved to produce different kinds of sulfur compounds. The
endermen really like to make one type which was DMSO. The DMSO would
be in gunpowder. When DMSO is added to potions, the potion is able to
be absorbed through skin.</p>

Gluciuum deposits start to form because a long time has passed. The

stuff, the endermen drilled for them. They drilled so fast that their
diamond drills broke and the diamond drills get left behind and
formed diamond ore in place of the emerald ore.</p>

The ghast had the song "white forces" in its head on
repeat. It had a thin skin that protects the red matter from it's
inside which was made of lots of antimatter. The legs are thrusters
that use antimatter annhiliation to thrust upward. It forms fireball
from air. When the ghast is punctured, the red matter goes inside
really fast, which makes all the antimatter disappear. Then only
thing left is the rest of the skin which forms the ghast tear. Ghasts
don't actually make tears. Ghast gets rid of waste by shooting them
out as fireballs. Ghasts are born very quickly that is why there are
gill shaped belly buttons on them. Ghasts have 2 parents but no
genders and reproduce by sporangia. A coincidence that shows that
ghasts are fungi is that mushroom soup in some minecraft servers
gives regeneration just like ghast tears. The 2 ghast hyphae touches
and make the sporangia. The sporangia grows into a baby ghast that
detaches leaving 2 belly buttons. Ghasts like to spawn around soul
sand with the same reason why nether wart likes to spawn there too.
Some ghast once wanted to do what the lyrics is in white forces.

tells the ghasts that the enemy is frozen, so the new weapon should
be firey. The ghasts decided to create the blaze. In order to use the
weapon, the ghasts turn into spawners. "<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">深淵に潜むその敵を</span></font></font>"
tells the ghasts that the enemy is in the abyass. The ghasts decide

tells the ghasts about what the blaze spawner looked like. The ghast
thinks that black sentence was jail sentence because the ghasts are
americans. The ghasts believed that wrapped in strength means that
the blaze rods orbit around the center. Echoing means repeating, so
the blazes are built like the center of the blaze spawner is. A way
to see how popular this theory is is to ask ChatGPT to write a song
titled "tears in force" to see if it references minecraft.

happen. "<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">いま響く黒の宣告生き抜くその先に待っている未来信じて</span></font></font>"
tells the ghast to design the spawner so that it is long lasting. So
some spawners were carried into the overworld so that it is protected
in dungeons. Spawners like the number 200, so they give birth on 200
because spawners are tech in a net so they like technetium which has
a mass of 97, and the room around them are red and the element named
after red is rhodium which has a mass of 103. 97 plus 103 is 200. 97
and 103 are the closest primes to 100. Since blaze powder cannot be
produced in the overworld, the spawners spawned zombies and
skeletons. Skeletons were chosen because they look like and attack
like blazes. Zombies were just flesh version of skeletons. The moss
is placed there to keep out red matter. Nether fortresses were built
in the nether coordinates corresponding to overworld Rainforest,
Seasonal forest, Ice desert, and Shrubland to protect the ghasts from
endermen. The ghasts don't know english so they cannot follow things
listed in the chorus.</p>

Spawners trained neural networks. Slime intelligence never developed.
Slime cells that can act as neurons are more like brain cancer cells
because the slime cells also compete against each other. So,
intelligence cannot develop because the pathway to intelligence is
improbable to get to. In conclusion, slime cells in a neural network
are incentivized to eat each other. Spawners decide to train neural
networks. Because heat in the spawners also destroy neural networks
even if the slime brain cells themselves can survive the heat, the
spawners need to use blaze powder to save the neural network. So, the
first slimes were actually magma cubes. The magma cubes reproduced by
teaching new magma cube cells into a brain. Some magma cubes went to
the overworld which they turned into slimes because blaze powder
cannot be produced outside of the nether. The slimes are able to make
slime brains without having the brains devolve because the
evolutionary leap was already leaped. The spawners also went to the
overworld. But, the spawners cannot spawn slimes because there isn't
a way around the fire resistance problem other than blaze powder.</p>

tells the ender dragon to team up with endermen. "Schwarzesmarken
arms now!" tells the ender dragon to choose the mig-23. Mig-23
is the flogger which is usually black whips tied together. The reason
why the the word "Energy" was capitalized is so that the
capitalised letters in the chorus that is about the ender dragon
spells 'Lies" which is close enough to 'Lise'. Another reason
why 'Energy' is capitalized ('energy' and 'over-g' sound like they
have shared suffix) is that it means the opposite of 'Over-g'. This
means that the ender dragon can fly without worrying about getting
damaged from accelerating too much. The opposite of the prefix
"Over-" is "inner-" which makes the word
"inner-g" which is spelled as "Energy". Floggers
as in whips, experience extreme amount of g-force at its tips when
used. However the amount is still inner-g and not over-g.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The ender dragon choose to have its eyes to have the same color as
the aerogel suits that the characters wear in schwarzesmarken. This
is because the ender dargon is analogous to the mig-23 therefore the
ender dragon eyes are analogous to the cockpit where you would see
the chracters in purple aerogel suits. All the endermen followed the
advice by perpetually blinking.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The ender dragon is made of scandium because the both mig-21 and
mig-23 are made of it. Not only that but the minecraft scandium is
scandium-44 and is not radioactive in minecraft. 21 plus 23 is 44
which is another reason to choose 44. 44th element is ruthenium which
means russia (russia is where the mig-21 and mig-23 originated from),
but the endermen does not know that because they count elements by
isobars. When endermen gets hit by the ender dragon, the endermen
feels a molecular weight of 44 which makes them think it is diatomic
element 22, and the endermen gets angry and remember Nico Yazawa's
birthday and attack the ender dragon.  Not related to minecraft
theory: Sumipe is 33 and 33 is looks like 44, so that is why Sumipe
should marry me. A way that endermen can convergent derive the name
scandium is from the word "dragon scales". Don't wait for
me to turn 22. If scandium is radioactive in minecraft, then the
endermen would think to cleanse calcium-44 from themselves by eating
strontium. The reason why the red dragon does not exist is because
since scandium-44 can be made from the stellar alpha processes, it
outnumbers scandium-45 by a lot. The red dragon would be made of
isotopically pure scandium-45 because the 45th element is rhodium
which means "red". The reason why the red dragon is weaker
is because heavier isotope means denser for the same strength which
means less specific strength. To accommodate the same load,
scandium-45 would need to raise its quantity to a power of 45/44
which can be a lot if the constants are large. Scandium comes with
aluminum, and al is 13th which is "two souls-towards the truth-"
which there are 2 of a lot of things:  aluminum and scandium, mig-21
and mig-23, 10 and 21, red and ender, scandium-44 and scandium-45,
Eli Ayase and Yoshino Nanjou, diatomic, love with you, and Jean. The
ender dragon needs to hit the endermen in order for the endermen to
feel element 22 because 22nd mv is "love with you".</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Why was the ender dragon named "Ender dragon" instead of
"The russian dragon", "Ruth the dragon named Jean",
or "dragon With tears in force" (capitalization in
reference to the chorus of the song "white forces"). It is
because the ender dragon is made of scandium which is the 21st
element, and the 21st mv in fripside infinite clip 2020 is "Edge
of the Universe" which suggest that it is the end. The ender
dragon update is the 10th minecraft beta update. 10th mv is black
bullet which also describes the ender dragon. (already written in the
same document a long time ago) 10 and 21 makes 10/21 which is Eli
Ayase birthday.  If the dragon was named after that, it could be "EA
dragon", "jEAn dragon" (the j and n stands for Yoshino
Nanjou. EA stands for Eli Ayase, Electronic Arts, and Effective
Altruism. On December 20 2024, vsauce released a #short video (with
an youtube id of Pv9HuVH9BbY ) which he said that the j in Jesus came
from a y in ancient languages. The reason why the dragon egg doesn't
hatch is because "jEAn is an eggbeater" (A reference to the
youtube video with id of Pv9HuVH9BbY ) Why is it "Eli Ayase and
Yoshino Nanjou" instead of "Eli Ayase as Yoshino Nanjou"?
because both Eli Ayase and Yoshino Nanjou is (signular tense) the
ender dragon. Ea nasir has EA and n follows. E in cyrillic is ye
which means that it is actually jean. He was selling copper which is
the lesbian element. Although poverty and technology would limit him
to just copper and bronze, he could have sold other thing which makes
it a coincidence.), "xopowo dragon","xbow wow dragon",

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Another reason why it is red dragon and black dragon is that russia
and china are allies. Dragons in fairy tales come in red, black, and
green. Ender meaning ruthenium which means russia, and red dragon is
chinese. Since they are enemies to the protagonist and each other,
that means that minecraft is nato propoganda.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The ender dragon also carries a end exit portal which it lays its
eggs. The dragon eggs teleport to  extreme hill biome because that is
"high stone". (hohenstein in english means high stone) The
exit portal is also a high stone because when the end generates, the
exit portal is placed above the highest block at 0,0. Even though the
exit portal doesn't spawn like it later version, the dragon usually
flies high which makes the exit portal to likely be high. The dragon
eggs hatch into silverfish just like mig-21 is a smaller version of
mig-23, and mig-21 is a fish.</p>

The endermen are experimenting with endermen spawner. The endermen
was more intelligent than all the other mobs that went into spawners.
The endermen knows that their biggest enemy was another endermen.
That is because of politics. The endermen formed cults. Their cults
believed that the leader endermen is the best endermen and a way to
eugenics them was to use a spawner. They built strongholds. The
confusing structures because they know the map but any attacking
endermen does not. To prevent the attacker from ambushing by going
through the wall, the endermen harvest silverfish from places to
build them into the stronghold. Endermen need research so they have

(copied from 2023 version) The wither has 2 modes. When it is over
half health, it is using mending enchantment. When it is below half
health, it is using infinity enchantment. Infinity and mending cannot
be used at the same time. The mending enchantment converts imaginary
kinetic energy to real kinetic energy. On items, real kinetic energy
repairs the item. On the wither, it propels the wither up. When the
wither is below half health, the wither uses infinity enchantment as
an active protection system. When the wither detects an arrow, the
wither uses infinity to produce another arrow that counters the
arrow. The infinity arrow despawns after an elastic collision.
Infinity uses kinetic energy to produce infinity arrows. The infinity
bow works by using kinetic energy from pulling the bow to make an
infinity arrow. Infinity does not work on potion arrows or specter
arrows because it only detects kinetic energy. Mending cannot be used
with infinity because infinity would consume the kinetic energy and
break the bow by producing a bunch of infinity arrows inside the bow.</p>

(copied from 2023 version) Sharpness and Bane of arthropods are not
actually enchantments. However they still use enchanting to get
because without gears, there are no microtechnologies that can change
the mechanical properties to make sharpness or bane of arthropods.
Sharpness makes items sharp by changing the microstructure of the
item and sharpening edges. Bane of arthropods creates microscopic
holes in the item. When an arthropod gets hit, their instinct causes
their bodies to try to infest the item which causes part of the
arthropod to stick on the item as if it was barbed. The arthropod is
slowed down because the arthropod is being pulled by the seemingly
barbed item. The microscopic holes activate the arthropod's instinct
because holes means that the item can be infested. Sharpness cannot
be applied to bane of arthropods because the enchantment would
mistake the holes as edges and bevel the item into oblivion. Bane of
arthropods cannot be applied to sharpness because the enchantment
cannot detect sharp edges and blunt the item and ruin microstructure
because creating the holes cause the lattices to misalign. The result
is an item that would be too brittle to use.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
(copied from 2023 version) Smite is sharpness with dullness
enchantment. It does sharpness damage to undead and the dullness gets
negated to do extra damage. To other mobs, the dullness negates
sharpness and does damage as if it was not enchanted.</p>

The endermen successfully made the endermen spawner. But, the spawner
was also intelligent. It is like AI in real life but actually
dangerous. The spawner steals the lab rat endermen's abilities and
teleported endstone around it to protect itself. The enderstone is
infinitely regenerating making it indestructible. The endermen put a
blaze powder and enderpearl on it and it got stuck forever. The end
portal frame is trying to make a permanently open portal to the end
in order to get revenge aginst the endermen. The endermen think it
was malicious, so they abandon it. The spawners formed in 13 and
invaded other stronghold by using the endermen's ability to teleport.
The spawners made the end portal room using 13 lava blocks and 13
spawners. The spawners were high up because they are named
"Hohenstien". At least one end portal was opened, so it
made a sound that can be heard anywhere. All the blazes and spawners
listened and knew to use blaze powder that can combine to make eye of
ender.</p>

The melon evolved to be more and more air. The air pockets on the
melon has so much surface tension that it can pull gold into thin
wires like gold open cell foam. Player cannot separate the gold
because it is too fragile. Gold couldn't be used as a powder because
particle coating cause coagulation cause the particle size to rise.
When the glistering melon go into the potion, the melon part dissolve
without having any effect, but the gold foam can easily react with
the potion because of surface area, and give the potion healing
effect. Gold without enough surface area would not react with the
potion. So, the glistening melon potion is actually the gold potion.
Gold things like golden apples are know for giving absorption effect.
Instant health is the most like absorption because it gives health
for one time.</p>

pick it up because of curiosity which the player never had picked up

Bed changed for looking too communist. The white bed is default, but
it coincidentally matches the color of mig-21 in schwarzesmarken. It
is a coincidence because beds are used to defeat the enderdragon like
how mig-21 and mig-23 fought against each other in schwarzesmarken.</p>

Phantoms finally made it to the overworld. The cat brings phantom
membrane because phantoms know that the next thing they would become
is the cat because f-14 tomcat replaced f-4 phantom in real life. The
player has to be in the bed because in order to splash the f-4
phantom, you need to be on the enemy's side which has the fish bed.
Cats also bring fish while the player sleeps because mig-21 fishbed
fights against the f-14 tomcat.</p>

Muons gather in large enough quantities in ancient debris. When gold
is added, the muons get absorbed into the larger atom. The muon
changes the electron clouds because its weight makes it sink in. Gold
has lots of relativistic properties which muons would amplify them.
The gold with muons gets more relativistic properties which makes it
able to catalyze diamonds into lonsdaleite. The piglins are there to
gather as much muons as they can. They think getting enough muons
would summon <font face="Liberation Serif, serif">μ</font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif">'s.

Allay thinks that a mob is intelligent when it is given a an item
containing iron, silicon, and oxygen because those are the 3
innermost layers of a star that is about to go supernova. When it
thinks that the mobs is intelligent, the allay duplicates because it
is a mob worth living for. The only item with iron, silicon, and
oxygen in equal enough proportion to make the allay think it was
deliberate is amethyst. Amethyst is glass like, and the allay and
amythest are light blue and purple because garden of glass is light
blue and purple. (<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">硝子の花園

gaiden in japanese.) Neither light blue or purple sing  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">これからの</span></font></font>Someday

</span></font></font>causing the allay to be stuck in the void after
July 22 of the 15th year of the millennium. The allay knows about
astronomy because it was taught by the beacon lights that the
endermen released from the nether. The beacon lights came from iron,
silicon, and oxygen. Allay has high regeneration because it is on the
warden's team and doesn't want to be accidentally killed and to be
able to live in the void. Before feburary 11, 2024, I thought that it
is such a disappointment that eliumi cannot exist in real life even
though storm in lover is a better song than  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">硝子の花園</span></font></font>.
However, if  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">硝子の花園
</span></font></font>was eliumi, then it would be even more
disappointing that the allay and amethyst were gay baiting. Storm in
lover is much less of Nozomi Tojo style than <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">硝子の花園</span></font></font>.
The copper golem was a close choice to the allay. It is a coincidence
because allay is a reference to lesbians, and copper is the lesbian
element.</p>

Amethysts are proposed to be added to end. The end is the anti-wither
place because the void damage only does it against the wither.
Therefore, it is a coincidence.  Amethysts were coincidentally chosen
to add to the game. Alternatives could have been opal which is
rainbowy white. There could have been added a cool allay animation
where the rainbow turn into light blue like scifi magic if opals were
chosen. Light blue symbol is <span lang="ru-RU">Я </span><span lang="en-US">which
means capital i and then insert philosophical rant about allay and

Although, some have very weak coincidences with their corresponding
number, I need to put it out there in case other people put out their
theories. To test how strong the coincidences, see if there are other
coincidences with other discographies or in a different ordering.  So
I decided to connect each minecraft version to its corresponding
fripside album or mv. The ordering is based on the numbering in
2020.04.01 - fripSide infinite video clips 2009-2020 and the new
albums get number one by one</p>

2nd music video is level5 judgelight. In a different text file, I
have wrote about that 2 connects to level5 because 2-ary logic can do
anything that 5-ary logic can. However 5-ary logic is confusing
because there are lots of different gates that takes 2 input and
return one output and is not easily converted back into 2-ary logic
since 5 is coprime to 2. The version is the 1st version to have code
obfuscation which is like programming in 5-ary logic. The b-side is
memory of snow. If it is obfuscated, the memory should be like snow.
It looks uniform from afar because of encryption. It actually
contains lots of information like complex snowflakes.</p>

In the 3rd music video, nanjolno was in a cave. This version of
minecraft adds cave generation. also the title of the music video is
future gazer which  means to gaze into the future. So this version
gazes into the future and skip a couple of numbers</p>

9th music video is eternal reality. The title has reality which means
that you can't really gaze over it because you wouldn't be able to
survive. It is eternal which means long time that contains the
future. It is more realistic because added build mode.</p>

10th music video is black bullet. The minecraft version is unplayable
which is like getting hit by a black bullet. There is also a time in
music video where the time pauses like how this version added game
pause. Clockwork planet mv doesn't count as a pause because it is
actually time reverse. People might think that is no big difference
between no time and negative time because negative time added to
positive time gets no time. However, theoretical physics treat them
very differently because of tachyons. Theoretical physics is relevent
because the b-side is pico -SACLA- which is about physics.</p>

0.0.1.11</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
11th music video is infinite synthesis. The music is named the same
as the albums of phase 2. It is analogous to naming a minecraft
version as minecraft. 0.0.1.11 is named as minecraft because the
version is used to mark anniversaries and is the first public
version. Even more coincidence is that in the mv, there were a wall
of cube blocks, and the main character jumps through them like a
minecraft animation. Another coincidence that shows that it counts as
the first minecraft version is that 0.0.1.11 is the first version
number with only ones and zeros. The first version of something is
usually named with only 1s and 0s.</p>

12th music video is Luminize. Luminize like how lava was added to the
version. In the single, there is also unlimited density which is
bedrock. Although many people think that it should be 0.0.1.13 that
adds bedrock like how the wither was added as chiseled sandstone in
1.12 with the wither added in 1.13, and bedrock being the chiseled
block (also that it is chiseled with wither skull) which foreshadows
the addition of sand and gravel (to be compatible with minecraft
theory which bedrock was the first block), 12 is also similar to 14
because 12^2 is 144. Bedrock and lava are added together because both
have been used to fill the bottom of the overworld.</p>

13th music video is Two souls -towards the truth- which was produced
in Netherlands. Netherlands is known for have land about the same
level as water and smooth terrain generation. In the minecraft
version, terrain generation is fixed to have land not always generate
above water and that the terrain is smoother. Minecraft version also
fix lava mechanics and lava, and netherlands have similar etymology.
It is also the world size test which means land. 113 is named after a
piece of land. And it is also japan which the music is in. Truth is
data. and the minecraft version has level save which means that you
can go towards the truth. Since there is no multiplayer, two souls
means that the single player comes in 2 which is only possible by log
out and log in.</p>

14th music video is white forces. In minecraft version, water flows
faster. Fast water is white, so it is white forces. The version adds
gravel, sand, ore, log, and leaves. It is the first version that is
compatible with my minecraft theory because
bedrock→stone→gravel→sand→dirt and ores exist and log→planks.
White forces is in the same album as 15th music video so they share
those similarities. The importance of why it is important to be
compatible to my minecraft theory is that white forces is in anime
which I use to help with my minecraft theory even in 2023 version.</p>

15th music video is 1983 schwarzesmarken. It is a music in the anime
that I use to theorize minecraft. This version is the 1st version
that is in my minecraft theory since my minecraft theory is only
about multiplayer version of minecraft. 0.0.1.15 is start of
multiplayer test. 115 is element Mc, and early classic minecraft
version names start with "mc_" which is abbreviation for
minecraft so that is another reason to start on it. 109 is element Mt
which is abbreviation for multiplayer test. multiplayer test code is
in 1.12 which corresponds to 112 which is the arithmetic mean of 109
and 115. 112 also adds bedrock which is a huge step closer to being
compatible to my minecraft theory. 109 adds building which is like
multiplayer because destroy mode and build mode. 0.0.1.9 is also the
first version of minecraft that is named in numerical order.</p>

_In the white forces mv, there is 3 headed cloud monster which is
analogous to the wither in minecraft. Both the wither and 3 headed
cloud monster are created the same way. Wither is from the
information on chiseled sandstone. And the 3 headed cloud monster is
from killing the 1 headed cloud monster (analogous to wither
skeleton) with a 3 headed cannon spawned from chiseled granite. Both
informations were used by humans. Both 3 headed things came from
blueprints like triple barrel and bloonchipper (autocorrects to
chancellorship) blueprints.</p>

the test bloon, it was a bloon made of alon. All the monkeys satisfy
thier urge on the bloon. the monkeys decided to name it after alon,
so it was aloon or called alon with 2 o's, but that got too confusing

#3032 eli ayase. #3032 skill effects are more unique than any other
skill effects because it is in person 5 style. The attribute is cool
and the skill is blue attendant which match the btdb user interface
color. 13 is a well known number because it is the legal age of

influencer award on the 13th seiyuu award. It was also the 1st time
giving the award which coincide with age 13. There were 10 URs from
the persona 5 collab. 1 for each of the 9 muse and 1 for llsif live
arena featured UR making the number of persona 5 eli ayase UR to be
2. A coincidence with chess is that #3024 eli ayase [which is from
persona collab] is designed from penthesilea which is an amazon
queen. Amazon is the strongest piece in youtube chess terminology
which is the only type of fairy chess that matters. #3024 skill is
Noble Steel Empress which has empress as in chancellor. It is
important that it is empress because youtube chess terminology is
backwards compatible with capablanca chess where the strongest fairy
chess piece is chancellor, and chancellor is mentioned in the bitcoin
genesis block, and nanjolno is satoshi nakamoto. So #3024 is the
strongest chess piece in both capablanca chess and youtube chess
terminology.</p>

is relevant in code geass. The featured UR is #3327 chika takami.
Chika takami is flat like an aerodynamic blimp called moab. The moab
is on round 18 and is also very famous because it is the first round
when moabs could be sent. 18 is a well known number because it is the
age of adulthood. The moab pops into 4 ceramics. The ceramic texture
when damage is partially a rainbow. Therefore, the rainbow should be
counted which another reason is that 8 and 18 ryhme. Another reason
is that round 18 is when fast cooldown ceramics could be sent which
inside are rainbow. There are 8 rainbows in a moab which is like
there being 8 orange tissues in the chika takami symbol, and there
are 8 other love live sunshiners.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">an idea in memory of
fisher is nazi chess. It is fisher random except the white queen is
replaced with chancellor which is  0.5 point less than queen. This
balences the odds for black in 960. It is nazi because the country
with chancellor attacked first. Nighted queen is nepotist. So,
nighted queen is nepotist or amazon or penthesilae, and
queen+nightrider is dickrider or penthesilae. empress is
chancellor+king. bishop and knightrider is pope. It should be named
empress because would be as valuble as queen. that means that add ess
to move like king. If the leaper is turned into rider then it would
be amazon. so from lowest value to highest: pawn, knight, bishop,
king, rook, knightrider, bishopess, dame, archbishop, archbishopess,
chancellor, queen, empress, pope, popess (or papess, bloone, peepo,
people), penthesilae, dickrider. Excluding, camo, zebra, regen,
rainbow, and rider version and combination of the. fortified meaning
that it is a rider. dickrider+fortified camo+fortified zebra would be
septhesilae.  septhesilae+fortifed regen rainbow would be octhesilae.

</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">fuhrer is rook +
nightrider. emporer is chancellor + king. empress is fuhrer + king.
another name for rainbow + zebra is bowzer as in mario. a piece that
moves like king should be named amazonian. Penthsilae can hop over,
eat, move to any square within 2 sqaures even if there is a piece
blocking and move like queen. penthesliae cannot hop over a piece if
it is 2 squares away, but it can it is beside it. If it is just being
able to move, eat, hop over within 2 squares, then it is unqueened.
so it applies to septhesilae and octhesilae. queen + knight is
knighted queen. World war chess variant is fisher 960, but white has
chancellor instead of queen to balance the eval bar. It is
historically accurate for the name because fisher was an antisemite.
pawn can promote to pawn, emporer, queen, fuhrer, unqueened
penthesilae, and pieces that are weaker. It is fortified if it can
ride on camo or regen. It is leaded if it can ride on zebra or
rainbow. camel if it is only camo. region if it is only regen.
camgrow if it is both camo and regen. Regrow camel if it is only
camgrow. The symbol of regrow camel is the humps angled to look like
a heart. and it has 1 tit.</p>
