<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">In
the beginning there was a neutron star in the universe which is the
surface of a hypersphere. Life in the universe began on the surface
of the neutron star. It was the nether wart. The nether wart lived on
the surface of the neutron. To survive the harsh conditions, the
nether wart needs to be resistant to mutations in the dna-like
information and in the brain. The nether wart grew a smart and fast
brain, but it was slow to learn because that would be mutation. The
nether wart discover that their only hope to spread outside of the
neutron star was to use lithography to etch a new lifeform from far
away. The nether wart couldn't etch the lifeform in their own solar
system because the neutron star would destroy any life that lived
nearby. The nether wart had to create the lifeform far away around
other stars. The nether wart calculated what possible alternative
biochemistry could be possible without nuetronium and can survive
outside of the neutron star. The nether wart used lithography to
create alanine based life far away from the neutron star. The life
eventually evolve into the many other life including endermen and
endermen's microbiome. Either endermen or another species in alanine
based life used lithography to create computers which were nand based
life. The neutron star was also a pulsar which spew beams that were
bent by the hyperspherical universe to create a fake sun and moon
back on the surface of the neutron star. The beams were asymmetric
because the particles have different reaction to gravity. The beams
have a moon cycle because of wave interference with each other from
meeting about halfway due to positive curvature of the universe, and
the angle that they meet keep changing because the universe was
constantly expanding. The moon light is mostly made of non-bosons
that do not have antigravity properties, so it is able to penetrate
more due to blueshift when falling down. The sunlight is mostly made
of non-bosons that have antigravity properties, which is much less
penetrating because they don't blue shift when falling down. However,
the magnetic field from the neutron star blocking the non-boson
radiation is so strong that almost nothing can detect the day and
night cycle. </font></font>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
universe starts to expand while being steady state for the neutron
star. This made the neutron star bigger really fast. The neutron star
collapse creating a singularity in the middle. It left 2 outer shells
of neutronium behind. The 2 shells interacted with modified gravity
to stay the gravitationally stable. Since modified gravity does not
follow newton's shell theorem, the inner shell split into a lower
shell and a middle shell due to different gravitation interaction
with the upper shell. The lower and middle shell was the nether and
the upper shell was the overworld. The nether was filled with holes
because of the gravitational reaction while the overworld had no
holes. The universe is still expanding which alters the wave
interference between the sunlight and moonlight causing the moon
cycle. Even though the source of the magnetic field is gone inside
the black hole, the magnetic feild still works because of light lag.
The magnetic field is still blocking most of the non-bosons. The
magnetic field gives out its own radiation which is like sunlight but
harmless. The nether wart had lost their energy source because the
nuetronium relied on the neutron star core to produce energy. The
nether wart stopped growing. The extreme environment of the neutron
star disappeared.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Because
everything else did not expand with accordance to its own energy
density, the neutron star became the largest object in the universe
pulling everything including intelligent life from far away towards
it. Any matter that wish to survive without falling into the
singularity would have to be able to teleport on to the surface of
the 3 shells of neutronium. The first creatures to inhabit the
minecraft world were endermen. It was because they were able to
survive the fall down from the event horizon to the overworld by
teleportation. So, it was natrual selection that created
teleportation and endermen. All other items that fell through were
going so fast, that their radiation length were really long. This
means that they reacted very little when they fall through. The anti
gravity from the neutronium shells prevented the light from blue
shifting when falling to the ground. So, the endermen were able to do
astronomy in minecraft. </font></font>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">When
the endermen's ancestors were trying to evolve teleportation. Some
ancestors had already detect the gravity, so they were able to know
the problem. They solved it while still falling to the minecraft
world. All other lifeforms were not able to evolve teleportation
making all remaining life being the descendants of either nether
wart, endermen, endermen's computers, or endermen's microbiome. The
nether wart was in the nuetronium based life domain. Endermen and
endermen's microbiome are in alanine based life domain. Endermen's
computers are in nand based life domain.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After
landing on the overworld, the endermen used nether reactor core to
teleport to the nether. The nether had almost nothing but some pieces
of neutronium. Some endermen drop down the nether with neutronium to
place it randomly. A few pieces were placed in the correct spot to
form the main end island. There was a place (different from the main
end island) in the internether void where endermen could teleport
over and over again to the same spot making it seem that they have
anti-gravity. The endermen use teleportation to pull matter from the
singularity. Because of the no hair theorem, the matter is always the
same being endstone. It was called endstone because the end product
of falling into a blackhole is becoming endstone. The endermen and
the endstone made up the outer end islands. Outer was only in
perspective of the main end islands only after the main end island
connects to it. There were no radial gaps in the outer end islands
and there were no center.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Void
is a pun. All portals teleport to the singularity. They just differ
in the where it is teleported out of the singularity. Since the
output is the same place as input then it is void because default
answer is the same place. This also makes end island also a void
portal since the definition of default changed from the place of
transportation to the place of the original portal. The default place
could also mean staying in the singularity which means that the
object is destroyed. The void portals lit with a bedrock frame would
produce a portal that does just that.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Because
the speed of light is finite, the neutron star's magnetic field was
still strong. It blocks the matter pairs that were produced from
blueshifted light. The magnetic field was so strong that it produced
an aurora that outshines all the light in the sky. Therefore, the sky
looks like it was always sunny. Since the magnetic field blocks the
particles, none of the particles would affect the surface like the
day and night cycle.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">As
the time passed, the neutronium decayed into bedrock. The bedrock
decayed into stone in the overworld and netherrack in the end. The
nether wart in the bedrock could not survive coming out of the
bedrock because nether wart needs to come out intact at once to
survive, but the bedrock decay is gradual and slow. The endermen made
glassware and quartz from the stone. Endermen were able to use
glassware to observe the stars through the blinding aurora. The most
important discovery that the endermen made were about noble gases.
Like in real life, the process were all the same except for helium
because there are no petroleum reserves in minecraft. </font></font>

starlight that was observed by endermen was still the same light that
was close to the nuetron star right before the steady state
expansion. But, the starlight close to the nuetron star will
eventaully land, and the endermen will end up observing the starlight
far away. The starlight close to the surface of the neutron star
expanded with conservation of energy density. Since the surface of
the nuetron star is very smooth, the change between old starlight and
new starlight will happen very suddenly. The minecraft crust used
antigravity to prevent the starlight that was close to neutron star
surface from blueshifting. </font></font>

that was observed by the endermen has an average mass of 3 in
minecraft. Helium natural abundance in real life is 137 in 100000000
which has number 137 which shows that changing the number changes
lots of physics like real life physics to minecraft physics. The
endermen named helium as helion because it followed the -on ending
for noble gases. (helion in english means a helium isotope that
weighs 3) Helion was observed on the ground only as a decay product
of tritium, but it was only observed in the stars. The sky was always
bright. (helium in english means "sun") The endermen think
of bright things as closer to holy than the dark things, so the
endermen thought the stars were holy. Some endermen think the stars
are angels hanging around above the transparent firmament. Endermen
conclude that tritium and helion were the same element because the
mass was the same. Endermen name tritium to something similar to
trinity because it was glowing and can make glowing water. Since
tritium was really rare, endermen never were able to collect much of
it. Endermen thought if they get a bulk amount of helium, they would
be able to make something powerful like an angel. Endermen believed
in fusion, but it was from hydrogen to deuterium to tritium, and
elements with mass of 4 to 6 were skipped. Endermen named deuterium
because when endermen first discovered it, they didn't realize that
it was diatomic. So endermen measured a value of 4 which the endermen
named it after the 4th book of the bible which is actually the 5th
book of the bible.</font></font></p>

in minecraft has an average mass of 21. It was first discovered in
the atmosphere. (neon in english means "new") After it was
already named, the endermen discovered it in supernova and in the
stars before they went supernova. Since the endermen forgot why neon
was named neon, the endermen thought neon means that it was a new
star forming instead of a star dying. Because the neutron star
remnant is more positive in absolute brightness, it was actually a
star disappearing from the endermen's view. Neonite was impossible to
exist because all elements with 20-22 mass other than neon are very
radioactive. Sometimes, the endermen observed a star with large
amounts of neon which was much more proportions than even supernovas.
The endermen believed that it was an important stars because neon was
the element of new. They observed that the star also had lots of
oxygen and another element, that the endermen say "OMG".
Because oxygen was already named as O, the endermen named the new
element symbol as mg. Endermen didn't known whether or not the nuclei
weighed the same as neon, but the name "neonite" caught on
regardless.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Argon
has an average mass of 36 on the minecraft world, but it has an
average mass of 40 in minecraft. This is because argon-36 is produced
from stellar alpha process, but argon's natrual abundance is &gt;99.6%
argon-40. Argon was also discovered in supernova, but not as much. It
wasn't named yet. The argon in supernova remnant was discovered to
weigh 36, but on the minecraft world, it weighed 40. The endermen
thought it was just 2 different elements. The endermen decided that
the reason for the similarity in emission spectrum was because the
elements were so inert that it was hard to tell the difference using
chemical reactions, so it was named as inert. (argon in english means
"inert") Many endermen believed that the existence of 2
different inert elements is a God given analogy which shows that even
the most righteous, pure, clean, holy, .... earthly thing is no match
for the righteous, pure, clean, holy, .... thing in heaven. The
worldly argon weighs 40 which is not as interesting as the number 36.
"Jesus fasted for 40 days, but in heaven, he would have fasted
for 3 consecutive periods of 12 days" the endermen reasoned.
Although the endermen did known about potassium, the endermen didn't
know of a argonite because the potassium-40 was too rare to discover.
(most argon-40 comes from potassium-40 decay) Potassium's molecular
mass was measured to be 39. Coincidentally, the endermen named
argon-40 as Kalium with a symbol of K. (kalium is an old name for
potassium and K is the symbol for potassium) It is a coincidence
because the isotope of argon that was named was the one that
originates from potassium-40. K in reference to krypton and
kryptonite (both words start with K in english) which one type is in
space, but the other on the minecraft world. Kalium was used as a
name to make a reference to calcium (kalium and calcium sounds the
same in english) which is the element kryptonite is known to replace.
Even more coincidental is that calcium has a stable isobar at 40. The
endermen refused to name argon-40 as argonite because the -ite ending
is reserved for naming an allotroph. Potassium has a symbol of Pp.
The endermen does not know it, but (in english word "p" "o"
"t" "a" "s" "s" "i"
"u" "m") every 2 letter combination is already
taken up in potassium. Po is polonium. Pt is platinum. Pa is
saturnium. Ps is positronium. Pi is pionium. Pu is plutonium. Pm is
promethium. The only abbreviation left is Pp. Argon-40 has 22
neutrons which would make the endermen hate the number 22. However,
endermen don't know what neutrons are, so the endermen could not
detect 22 in argon-40.</font></font></p>

spectrum was different, but the endermen reasoned it was just
different allotrophes. So, the endermen called strontium as
kryptonite. (kryptonite in english means "something that makes
superman weak") The ending part of the word to reference that
the type of krypton was solid. The endermen observed that when they
eat kryptonite, their brains work slower and they became weaker
despite the fact that strontium sounds like strong in english. The
endermen interpret the effects as surrendering oneself to God. (with
a capital G in english) Kryptonite replaces calcium in neurons and
muscle fibers. Slow neurons cause stupidity which cause more
religiousness which cause endermen to strengthen their belief that
strontium is good. Since kryptonite has a higher molecular mass than
calcium, it moves slower which slows the recharge rate of neurons and
muscle fibers.</font></font></p>

produce calcium-44 because scandium-44 ends the decay chain
prematurely. The most abundant form of calcium is calcium-48. The
endermen think that 48 is a reference to 84 that tells them to intake
kryptonite. (48 and 84 are copalindrome) Because calcium-48 has so
many neutrons, it is no longer the least dense alkaline earth metal.
Neonite is the least dense alkali metal and of all waterproof metals.</font></font></p>

that 7 is a holy number. Endermen believed the calming experience is
the effect of connecting to a higher reality. In fact it really is

are to heaven. Doubly in fact, the angel that would deliver the

that out of all the elements found on the minecraft world, only xenon
was discovered to be nowhere other than from blinking stars which was
also strange. So, it was named as strange. (xenon in english means
"strange") Although xenon was never isolated in minecraft

that they still have xenon. It was actually iodine. The spectrum were
a little different but it was still purple. Endermen dismiss the

was already named, but the endermen did not know why it was named
that. (iron in english means "holy") When the endermen
discovered the supernova, they found so much nickel which was an
element that is never discovered on the minecraft world. The nickel
had a half-life of 6 days which decays to cobalt that had 77 days of
half-life until it turns into iron. (both nickel and cobalt in
english means "devil") Both 77 and 83 (half-life of nickel
plus cobalt or approximately equal to bateman effective half-life)
are significant to the endermen. The 77th year of the centuary was
the year before the endermen government oppressed enderman using
Public Law 95-225. The nickel, cobalt, and iron all had a mass of 56
which is 7(8) which concatenate instead of multiply is 78 which is
when Protection of Children Against Sexual Exploitation Act of 1978.
The 83rd year of the centuary was the year before the book 1984 was
suppose to happen. The endermen concludes that since iron is holy,
then nickel and cobalt also relates. They were 3 elements which made
the endermen think that it is like the trinity as in the 3 crosses.
So the endermen named the 2 other metals as nickel and cobalt because
the 2 others on the cross were not Jesus. Another reason why the
endermen thought they were related to Jesus was that on average,
nickel decayed on the 7th day, and then stay as cobalt for 11 periods
of 7 days, and then finally turn into iron. In total, there were 12
periods of 7 days. 1 as nickel which represent the criminal on the
cross that criticized Jesus. the endermen compared him to Judas just
like there were 1 Judas and 11 other disciples. Because Judas sold
Jesus for money, nickel's symbol was the smile instead of the star.
(nickel sounds like nico yazawa which has the symbol of a smile) The
smile represents the obverse on the coin. Stable nickel from the
stellar alpha process was observed to be mass of 60. The endermen
believed that stable nickel was a different element than nickel. It
was just trying disguise itself like iron just like Judas being a
fake disciple, according to the endermen. The endermen could not
observe the zinc's decay chain because the half-life was so small.
The endermen concluded that 60 represents the number of smiles on 30
shekels of silver which judas got for selling jesus. Each shekel had
a smile on each side (instead of only on the obverse side) because
the shekels were extra greedy. Endermen collected lots of data. It
took a lot of data to determine the molecular mass of elements that
make small proportions of the supernova remnant. One of the elements
was manganese. It had a mass of 55 which was so close to 56 which
made the endermen say "OMG" so the endermen named it after
mg. It wasn't named after om because that was not an existing element
that the endermen named.</font></font></p>

endermen practiced their new beliefs, the endermen stopped leaving
skeletons when they died. This is because that kryptonite replaces

more water soluble which causes the skeleton to decay too quickly.
Endermen stored their dead in the nether because nether was spacious
without many important stuff. The nether heat destroys skeletons even
faster. The kryptonite (which leaked out of decaying endermen
skeletons) combined with aluminum oxide and europium to make
glowstone which makes clumps of glowstone everywhere in the nether.
(glowstone glows green in real life like kryptonite in superman
movies) Europium doesn't glow by itself, so the endermen who believed

because the emission spectrum of lithium is red, and 7 and 12 are
numbers that are alike which 7 corresponds to lithium and 12
corresponds to carbon. However some endermen believe that a blink is
best expressed with xenon because xenon is the element from the
blinking star. Another reason to choose xenon was that it had both 7
and 12 as digits of the atomic mass. Xenon was more convincing that
lithium, so the endermen use eugenics to make their eye blinks to be
purple color. Iodine which the endermen called 'worldly xenon' was a
bit pinkish. Xenon was a bit bluish. The endermen choose the average
which was a deep purple. Since the endermen picked iodine and xenon
as the color of their blinks, endermen gave iodine and xenon the
symbol of an eye. (in english, the letter 'I' that is used as the
symbol for iodine is pronounced the same as eye) In order to enforce
the eugenics program, when an endermen look at another endermen, they
had to blink. Blinking shows that the endermen has purple blinks. If
the endermen or thing that looks like an endermen (this includes the

Chromium doesn't have any part in the minecraft theory other than
being a byproduct of the alpha process. Calcium-53 has 20 protons

Calcium-53 decays into chromium-53. One reason why the endermen may
have named it chromium was that they discovered 2 elements (isobars)
with the same emission spectrum, so they named it based on color. In

The reason was that chromium to me means something hard, so I thought
hard means diamond which is diamond ring. I had overlooked the fact
that chromium is what gives rubies their color, and rubies were the

Take the smaller age and that is the number of protons, then take the

desert, and Shrubland, so the player never sees them. Dead endermen
combined with sand to turn into soul sand.</font></font></p>

discovered that nitrogen was 2 different masses. One is 14 and a
smaller portion is 15. The endermen Decides to name them light
nitrogen and heavy nitrogen. Since nitrogen was already thought of
being 14, the light nitrogen's name did not change. Heavy nitrogen
was given the symbol of Nh. (N stands for nitrogen. "h"
stands for heavy in english. (N is a symbol so no quotes are needed))
Endermen believed nitrogen is like lithium. They were accidentally
right because nitrogen is the 7th element and lithium weighed 7.
Nitrogen asphyxiation was harder to detect. When there is too much
nitrogen, not only would you get the same numbing effect like lithium
and wither, but also you wouldn't know that you were drowning, so the
bubbles were whited out on the player ui. Another coincidence is that
lithium magnesium alloy is the lightest waterproof alloy. Magnesium
is the 12th element which coincide with 7.</font></font></p>

The endermen could not agree on which type of copper to call copper.
Copper was discovered to be a weight of 64 and was given a symbol of
Cu. Then copper was isolated to light copper and heavy copper. Light
copper was a little more abundant than heavy copper by 69/31. Not
only that but heavy copper's abundance is 30.83 percent which is
amount of pure substance after 1.69759320544227 halflives which
contains the number 69. Endermen couldn't decide what the element
symbols should be. Cu is already 2 letters, so they cannot just add
another symbol. Some endermen found that the square root of 64 is 8
and 8th mv in fripside infinite clips is sister's noise. The sisters
referenced in the song both had copper colored hair. The younger
sister had a slightly lighter color hair than the older sister. Light
copper and heavy copper are like sisters. Cube root is 4 and 4th mv
has 2 girls and the one that is not nanjolno has copper colored hair.
2 is the 6th root and in the 2nd mv, Nanjou Yoshino has copper
colored hair. Some endermen believed that light copper's symbol
should be Sk which stands for Shirai Kuroko and heavy copper's symbol
should be Mm which stands for Misaka Mikoto. The endermen believed
that the size of the characters should correspond to the weight of
the element. Other endermen pointed out that Misaka Mikoto had 20000
clones and that the number of characters should correspond to the
abundance of the elements. The copper ore didn't exist because it was
still debated which copper should it be. The split of 69/31 caused 69
to be a symbol of sex because Shirai Kuroko is gay with Misaka
Mikoto. Furthermore, Shirai Kuroko is the more gay character which
corresponds to the element with abundance 69. The endermen made candy
named after sk which is skittles.  The hard, sweet, and addictiveness
is like gluciuum and lithium. The endermen wanted to be like lithium
and gluciuum because 7 times 9 is 63. M 'n m are named after Mm. The
endermen thought element with mass of 13 would be something like
carbon, so the endermen made it look black. And 5 might be no stable
nuclei but pleasant like "Heaven is a Place on Earth". So
the M 'n m is designed to be black and melts quickly.</font></font></p>

an endermen died, he thought that life was so nice that he would
always cherish the memories in heaven. Every endermen on his deathbed
would talk about how grateful he was in life and it just keeps going
on. The endermen's children would think that heaven would be much
more better than life on the minecraft world. The endermens' souls
ascended. The endermen were too right, heaven was too good. The
endermens' souls couldn't believe that they were tricked to continue
living a life so much worse than what they could have lived in
heaven. Nostalgia for their children faded away. The endermen wanted
to avenge for the time that they lost form not going to heaven
earlier. But first, they are just souls in soul sand and need a
weapon. They choose the alloy with the most specific strength. It was
lithium magnesium (endermen called magnesium as neonite) alloy, and
by weight, it was stronger than any nitinol, high entropy alloy,
steel, titanium alloy, aluminium-scandium alloy, maraging steel,
ferroalloy, tungsten alloy and others. It was the strongest metal
that is stable in stp. The high lithium content made it less dense
than water. The magnesium content was just high enough to not react
with water and be stiff. The armour was perfected with the exception
of isotope separation. It could have weighed a little less if it was
made from lithium-6 and magnesium-24 instead of lithium-7 and
magnesium-25. Although beryllium alloies are usually stronger than
magnesium alloies, beryllium cannot be alloied with lithium because
the intermetallic is unstable which eliminates the possiblility of
beryllium having a stronger alloy than lithium magnesium. The wither
skulls were also made of lithium. When it hits, the skull explodes
spreading lithium dust. The dust is hygroscopic and get absorbed into
the blood after displacing hydrogen. The lithium calms and numbs the
victim preventing the victim from knowing how much damage they took,
only able to know that they are taking damage. It is the same feeling
like when you trying to count the red tiny hearts from the black
hearts. The displacement of hydrogen causes damage like poison. Blue
skulls were blue because they contain magic that irradiates UV
catastrophe. Massive numbers of endermen souls gathered around ready
to reenter minecraft. The endermen souls knew that the wither cannot
teleport or even teleport to the same place because the temptation to
return to heaven is so strong that all the teleportation would be
redirected back into heaven. Since there were few soul sand in the
overworld, no withers were able to spawn there. The withers spawned
all at once evenly distributed in every chunk of the nether. They
quickly defeated all the endermen civilization in the nether. They
flew out through the top holes going to the overworld. They tried to
destroy the bedrock but it was only enough damage to imprint their
face into each block of bedrock. The face imprinting cause a build up
of cracks in the middle which created the borders of the modern
bedrock block to be in the middle of the wither face.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
reason why withers shoot wither skulls is that in heaven, the
endermen souls got to drink 7up. It tasted really good. It is known
that 7up was named for many reason which one is that it had lithium
which had mass of 7. The endermen souls also played heads up, seven
up. Since the wither decided to shoot out lithium, the wither decided
to shoot heads which are also skulls.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">After
all the withers left to attack the overworld, the endermen were
safely able to go back to the nether. The endermen concluded that it
was the burial practices that made the withers. Endermen cleaned up
the mess in the nether and piled the soul sand in clumps so that any
new wither attacks would be localized. The endermen trained
themselves to bury themselves into ender pearls. The endermen didn't
like water because it causes them to decay a bit, and the endermen
think that it might cause more soul sand to form. The endermen
designed the ender pearl to trap the souls which also traps the souls
from going to heaven. All endermen that turned into enderpearls would
live in boredom because they were forever stuck in the same place.
Ender pearls cannot blink because they are already dead, so the eye
of ender are always greenish-blue, and ender pearls are darker on the
inside. The blue from the ender pearl and eye of ender is from the uv
catastrophe radiation. Since souls and stuff are magic, they are not
quantum which causes them to emit uv catastrophe. Since no more
endermen bury themselves outside of the enderpearl, no more soul sand
were created. The sand and gravel in the overworld began to seperate
from the endermen souls since no new endermen souls were replinishing
them. They became less like soul sand and were able to sink in water
and lava.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
endermen looked up into the nether-overworld void. They saw it was
bright. They measured the emission spectrum and it matched lithium
and neonite. The endermen interpreted it as a sign of a 2nd heaven
existing in between the overworld and nether. So, the endermen named
the minecraft world on top as overworld. The name means that it was
over something. The 2nd heaven was interpreted as something much more
significant than the 1st heaven. The lithium which was suppose to
only be found on the ground was interpreted as endermen on the ground
can even ascend to heaven. The neonite was interpreted as something
that is new. Therefore, it should be named the 2nd heaven. The
endermen labeled it as an achievement but with a question mark. It is
like a happening but more like a sign. The achievement was called
"Beginning?"</font></font></p>

withers died from friendly fire and dropped wither stars. The wither
stars contained lithium and neonite. This proved that it was infact
lithium and neonite. So the endermen made the achievement to be about
a happening which was "Beginning." The endermen were able
to measure the molecular mass of neonite for the 1st time. It was 25.
Since the mass of neonite, 25, is different than the mass of neon,
21, it was supposed to be renamed, but the name had stayed for too
long for the endermen to want to change it. The endermen also found
that the item could not teleport or else it disappears. The endermen
thought that it was like a star because stars get eaten by
singularities and teleportation goes through singularities. So the
endermen called it as nether star. There were still some withers
around the bedrock surface of the nether, so the endermen were not
able to reach far up toward the 2nd heaven. Endermen decided to name
the 2nd heaven. They named it as "eastern capital". East
was used because east means new sun. New describes both the light and
neonite. They use japanese so it is </font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京</span></font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">.
The weight of 25 made endermen like the name for the element weighing
55. The endermen know that 5(5) is Mg and 55 is Mn. A coincidence
that endermen could not discover is that Magnesium has a weight of 25
and the 25th element is Manganese. Endermen did give neonite a
scientific name which is derived from "my God" part of OMG.
God is great and great in latin is magnus, so the endermen named it
as magnesium. Since magnesium is connected to God, lithium-magnesium
alloy means that God is returning to earth. Which is a big happening.</font></font></p>

A coincidence with neonite and lithium is that in real life the
highest specific strength would be neon and lithium alloy. Like
lithium and neonite being 7 and 25, lithium and neon have a isotope
with molar mass of 7 and 22. Neon turns metallic at high pressures.
Lithium has already been experimented in real life to alloy with
metallic hydrogen. Lithium stabilize metallic hydrogen at lower
pressures, so it is likely to do that with other metallic nonmetals.
Stabilize probably also means that it increase in strength. Lithium
etymology also coincide because lithium means earth which is were stp
is and lower pressures from metallic hydrogen is more like stp.
Another etymology coincidence is Lithium and Neon becomes LiNe which
is line. Lines are strong because they can carry weight with a low
cross section. I don't think there are other elements or mixtures
that are like that because more elements means less pure which
correlates to being a weaker alloy. And, heavier nuclei means more
molar mass which means less bonds per mass. Metallic hydrogen is
predicted to be more specific strength than any materials that are
stable in stp. It is likely that atoms that are more electronegative
have more molar strength in metallic state. Neon is the most
electronegative. Neon has a bigger atomic radius allowing it to
interact with more atoms and field strength to decrease less over
distance which makes metallic neon to be the strongest and most
specific strength pure metallic nonmetal. Things with higher specific
strength are atoms with lower molar mass. antimuonium hydride has
properties similar to helium which means that metallic neon would
have to be 20 times stronger than antimuonium hydride to beat
antimuonium hydride. There are other fermions but they are too heavy
to be considered. There are antimatter and matter pairs, but they are
unlikely to be strong as their counterparts because they need to not
hit each other. There are neutronium, nuclear pasta, quark gluon
plasma, electron degenerate matter, glueball, and other high energy
materials, but they depend on interactions at a short distance which
makes their specific strength really weak even though they have high
strength. Although the interactions in the high energy materials use
very fast and massive particles, it is only active support
implementation of it that could use the theoretical specific strength
because each of the particles can bond to another around them which
doesn't help confine them to a shape. Even in very high pressures,
they would have low strength like a liquid. Another reason why exotic
materials are likely to not have strength is that the observed
subatomic force may because of quantum stuff, so it doesn't scale. If
counting active support, photons would have the highest specific
strength. Therefore, metallic neon lithium alloy would be the most
specific strength material possible in the reasonable definition of
strength. If it is possible to have a stable nucleus with multiple
muons, then it is likely that the lightest stable neon isotope is 1.1
amu which is 1 proton and 9 muons. It cannot be 10 muons or it will
decay to 10 muoniums. Lithium would be 1 proton and 2 muons.  It is 9
muons like there are 9 muses in M's. It is a coincidence that saint
snow abbreviation is SS and they dress as black. Unlike lithium
magnesium alloy which in real life is definitely not the most
specific strength stp-stable non-exotic metallic material, I believe
that lithium metallic neon alloy is the most specific strength
material that can exist in real life. Neon metallicization pressure
is 2084 megabar which 2084 is 100 more than 1984 and looks like 2048.</font></font></p>

their dog died. The endermen were angry. "It must be element

endermen hated the number 22 because of july 22. Then a white
floating cube in the overworld was making cat (coincidentally)
sounds. It appeared on the same day, so endermen believed that the
ghast was the culprit. The endermen thought "it must be made of

like titanium dioxide. The endermen thought "if the ghast stayed
in the overworld, the ghast would cause the overworld sky to turn
into lava". It was also the 15th year of the millennial when the
events happened, the endermen interpret it as an element weighing 15
which is heavy nitrogen which also starts with N. And, 15 plus 7
(july) is 22. Since heavy nitrogen is so connected to the japanese
stuff, the endermen decides to change the name to be like japan. The
name nihonium was chosen because it is named after nihon, and it
coincidentally resembles the heavy nitrogen symbol. (On the contrary,
the sum of digits in light nitrogen weight is equal to the sum of
digits in atomic number of Uut, but heavy nitrogen is one off) A
coincidence that was created because it happened on the 15th year was
that in the 15th mv, the lyrics described a grey sky. The grey sky is
the bedrock sky in the nether. One coincidence that the endermen
couldn't know about is that 14 and 15 are the mass of the 7th element
(because endermen count elements by mass and not protons) and 14th
and 15th mv of fripside infinite clips are in fripside's 12th single.<span lang="en-US">
The coincidence is also notable because the 12th single is the only
single that contains 2 mv. Beside 7 and 12, another coincidence is

Why is it called bromide? Because if it is guys then it is gay. But
why is it called gay? Because Gallium and Yttrium. Why those 2?
Gallium has 2 isotopes. Gay is not natural, so don't use natural
abundance. How to counter argue against "gay is natural"?
Hypocritically say that "Well then nature is brutal and
barbaric" then cite lotr. Use assumption of equal probability
which concludes that the average nucleon is 39 nuetrons. 39 on the
periodic table is Yttrium. Therefore , it is Gallium Yttrium. Gallium
is 31 and 31 is twin prime with 29 which is copper. Copper average
equiprobable neutrons is 35 which 35 is bromine. So gay girls are
cubr which is a bromide. A gay girl is cuprous. cubr has a weight
ranging from 142 to 146. if equal probability, it is 144 and 44 is
russia element which explains that all russophile seiyuus are
cuprous. 14441 is sumire uesaka's myanimelist id. It has lots of 4's
and 1's just like 114. In cupric form, the average (Principle of
indifference) weight would be 224 which equals 15^2-1 which 15 is the
green mv like 14 is the white mv. (14 as in it looks like 144)
Gallium yttrium has an average weight of 159 which 59 is praseodymium
which means green twin like how cupric bromide would be the green
twin of cuprous bromide. Cuprous etymology is an island just like
lesbian etymology is also an island. The Lesbos island may have been
named for being wooded. Wood is hard and has the same color as
copper. Cyprus also may be been named from a wood. Praseodymium is
the gayest element. Excluding all the alkaline and alkali metals,
prasodymium has the largest atomic radius. The outermost electrons
are the valence electrons. If they are poking out, that is kind of
gay. Why is it 144 and not other number ending in 44? Because there
are 3 elements that are about russia. Element 14 is кремний <span lang="ru-RU">на
русском</span><span lang="en-US"> which sounds like кремль.
Element 44 is named after russia. Element 114 is the only element
between nihonium and moscovium. Nihonium because sumire uesaka is
japanese. Moscovium because sumire uesaka likes soviet union which is
when russia didn't exist, but moscow was capital. In fact, soviet
union moved the capital to moscow. A</span>nd, 144 is a byte entropic
average (don't know what the term is but the answer choice closest to
it would be the most likely answer in multiple choice questions) of
14, 44 and 114. Another reason why 144 is that 144=12^2 and 12<sup>2</sup>
paste as plain text is 122 which is stibium equiprobable mass. A
reason why gay girls are cuprous and not cupric is that cuprous
bromide is white which corresponds to the 14th mv. 14 looks like 114
and 144 and 44 which are russian. Cuprous bromide has lonsdaleite
structure like netherite. Another reason why it is green twin is that
copper bromide comes in green and white form, and the cupric form is
green. Cupric bromide is soluble in water just like how men, men's
saliva, and men's fingerprints contain more water per mass than
women. Anhydrous cupric bromide is black like how Yoshino Nanjou wore
both the DDT dress and ZOMG dress in 15th mv. Only if that was a
mixed color dude or ancient debris in the bag would it have been a
camgrow ceramic. Instead it was a yellow bloon. The reason why the
pink bloon was added to the game was that pink is triggered like
snowflake when the 3rd gen game implies that there are 2 asians in a
white or black. Stable nickel and stable cobalt are group together as
devil's element. Stable nickel weighs 60 and stable cobalt weighs 59.
They are like twins just like didymium etymology, and perceived to be
evil because didynium sounds like diddy. Some endermen believe that
there is another stable nickel which weighs 62 that is mistaken as
evil. The endermen believe that the second stable nickel would be
mistaken as a bad guy like how the good samaritan was mistaken as a
bad person by the jews. So, the hypothetical element that weighs 62
was named samarium. (Element 62 in real life is called samarium) Jews
say that the samaritans are enemies and therefore are not their
neighbors. However, not only does jesus say that they are neighbors,
but also that samarium and europium are adjacent on the periodic
table. (еврейский and европий<span lang="ru-RU"> </span>are
similar in pronunciation <span lang="ru-RU">на </span><span lang="ru-RU">ру</span><span lang="ru-RU">с</span><span lang="ru-RU">ск</span><span lang="ru-RU">ом</span>)
The smaller copper bromide compound is lesbian just like the smaller
copper isotope is shirai kuroko. Inconclusion, lesbium is copper, not
lithium. (which you would find on the internet) The smaller number is
more lesbian than the larger number. Copper 63 would have 34 which is
selenium. Selenium is named after the moon. Moon as in mooning and
moon as in nozomi symbol. And 34 as in rule 34. Copper 65 would have
36 which is krypton. Hiding is not very lesbian. However, muse fans
(according to some unofficial poll) have voted that umi to be the
most lesbian. The reason is that since umi tries to hide it, she is
showing the most lesbian traits. Another reason for umi is that Sb is
element 51 which area 51 is the most secret place because pop culture
said so. Some people may think umi is bow symbol which shoot
projectiles and bullet is a projectile. However, arrows are the
opposite of bullet because bullet is made of copper since it needs to
touch the barrel a lot. arrows don't touch a lot, so they are not
made of copper.  Praseodymium is big radius like how lead is dense.
There are other that are better in those categories but lead and
praseodynium are the practical ones. So, praseodynium is 82 nuetrons.
Another reason why einstienium should be renamed to milkyum is
because holmium is above it. The only stable isotope of holmium is
98n which element 98 would be the element right before einstienium,
but that is approximately correct for all the lanthanides. Therefore,
the name needs to match so that it is milky holmes. Out of all the
elements with only 2 stable isotopes, bromine is the closest to
equiprobability (which each isotope only differs by 0.69 percentages
from 50/50. 0.69 because it contains 69 like gay) which means that
bromide should mean a gift because bromine is the most sharing in
abundance. The opposite of bromine is rubidium because rb and br are
copalindrome. Rubidium is between equiprobability and monoisotope
being closest to 25/75 to distribution compared to all other elements
with 2 stable isotopes. Yttrium follows the arithmetic progression,
and yttrium is a monoisotope. 14, 114, and 14441 because nazi germany
became an enemy to soviet union in 1941.</font></font></p>

Having all the withers teleport back to heaven would be "The end

the fun stops and people have to go back to school. If you remove a
2, then it would be July 2. However July 2 is the end of summer if
you count that the seasons of the year following the order of spring,
summer, fall, winter with spring beginning at the start of the year.
July 2 is when busy beaven 5 was proven. When I learned of the news

"Heaven is a Place on Earth" to 5-ary logic. It is relevant
because busy beaven 5 is as incomprehensible as the output of 5 state

like them. "Heaven is a Place on Earth" was released on the
237th day of the year which is 8.24 . Element with a weight of 237 is
also NP, but the p is lower case. 8 and 24 refers to the 8th and 24th
dimension sphere packing which were solved with elliptic curves. It
won the abel medal in 2022 which was DEI because it was for support
of ukraine in ukraine war that started earlier that year. When
nanjolno became 24, it was 2008 which is the 8th year of millenial.
It can abbreviated to ec which convert from hex to decimal is 236
which is the other long living Np isotope or a long living U isotope.
The sphere packing solver was ukrainian which abbreviates to UA. The
"A" could be a placeholder like 0, so it is U, or A is
alloy. U is an element next to Np. "Heaven is a Place on Earth"
capital letters are H P E which convert from cyrillic is N P ye or
yo. U sounds like yo. "Heaven is a Place on Earth" was

Why is phosphorous P? because 15 and IUPAC is up. 15 as in 15th mv
where nanjolno was wearing the really cool dress that was as cool as
fascism. When phosphorous was discovered, it was used in magic tricks
because the production was kept a secret and phosphorous had really
cool chemical properties. So that is the similarity. Phosphorous is
nitrogen group. Nitrogen as in heavy nitrogen weighs 15. Arsenic is
connected to green like the green dress in 15th mv. Antimony average
weight of stable isotope Laplace's Principle of Indifference is 122
which means 12th single has 2 mv. Sb-123 natural abundance is 42.79
percent which is about the abundance of pure substance after 1.22
halflives. 4 Bismuth is german etymology and is white mass. White
energy is white mass times white force like white forces. Bismuth's
atomic number is 83 like in 1983-schwarzesmarken-. Bismuth symbol is
Bi which means gay and straight in english. I have made the joke
"What is Bi and turns crystals into the lgbt flag? bismuth"
ever since 2020. Before I wrote about it, I hated phosphorous because
it is the element that doesn't seem to have a alternative in life but
should. Sb as symbol means b-side which the 12th single was the only
phase 2 single where the b-side got a mv. The S is capitalized
because “side” in “fripSide” is capitalized but the 1st
letter is not capitalized. Therefore, if fripside were to be named an
element, it would be Sf and not Fs. Fs is already facisium which is
the name of element 87 before it was internationally recongnized.

which 1976 is when anti-pedo president won, and os because system76
and x86. Why 86? Because 1986 is machine gun ban. Shikaco was born on
the 3rd anniversary of machine gun ban. Shikaco is connected to
fascism because her birthday is 1989.5.19 which 1989 is 1889+100 and
5.19 is one off of 4.20 and 5+19=4+20 which is like hitler birthday.
President regan was really bad but president carter was even worse
and is the worst. Os also stands for operating system which is more
like a change in power than change in legislature. Sb is also
feminine because "lesbian" in english contains the
substring. Written before, copper is the other lesbian element.
Copper is most well known to be alloyed with Sn which is right beside
Sb. It is still a coincidence because 'N' is opposite of 'S'. The
second most well known element to be alloyed with copper is Zn, and
"Z" is just a "N" turned on it's side. It is a
coincidence because turning something is a sign that it is negated.
Moscovium because moscow is the place most associated with fascism
compared to the places that share a name with an element. Its
chemical symbol is Mc which also stands for minecraft. Antimony
etymology is not alone. Not alone like how the 14th mv is not alone
because there is the 15th mv in the same single. Many people want to
believe that it means anti-monk, but that coincidence would be
absolutely boring. Sb atomic number is 51 which reversed is 15, and
reverse of 14 is 41 which is Nb which N and S are opposites. North
and south, nakamoto and satoshi. Nb number of nuetrons is 52 (only 4
odd odd stable nuclei) which is one off of 51. Sb number of nuetrons
is 71 which skip 16 because 16th mv is not related to csam and stuff.
Why is it arsenic instead of germanium? If germanium then bismuth
would not be a coincidence. Arsenic is masculine etymology like
stibium (odd english name, works with antimony because staying
together is also feminine) is feminine etymology. Not only is arsenic
opposite of stibium, but also arsenic is opposite of phosphorous
which is named for producing light. Arsenic is known for absorbing
light to produce energy in both in the most light-absorbing plant,
(same as most photosynthetic) brown algea (correlation not
causation), and photovoltaic. Although germanium and other elements
are also used for photovoltaic, their other uses overshadows
photovoltaics. Why 52 neutrons? Arsenic was compared to germanium. On
the other side would be tellurium which is element 52. In world
building, oxygen would bind to the main component of crust. If the
crust was made of either tellurium or germanium, the abbreviations
would be TeO and GeO, both of which means earth in english prefixes.
Around Te, it would be Sb I which is a substring of lesbian. Spelling
the lesbian with chemical symbols would be Re Sb I. There isn't a
element with a symbol of L, Le, Ia, or An. Many people many be
disappointed that arsenic was not thought of as a poison. However,
phosphorous is known as the biggest limiting factor to interstellar
life. It is not as useless as a metal which can be replaced with
another metal, and it is not as common as water. Phosphorous means
light-bearing which "light" can be a euphemism for life.
Arsenic is known as the opposite of light-bearing because of its use
in photovoltaics which [applying the euphemism for life] means that
it is a biocide.</font></font></p>

work. Excluding trivial solutions, only (21,12) and (31,13) works in

the 1st regiment of something would be 101, and 101 in base 21 is

19 and 22. 19 because of sad day that nanjolno betrayed me by going
to south korea. 22 because sad day for the endermen in my minecraft
thoery. But why else 19 and 22? If instead of sodium/potassium to
balance electrolyte and run ion pumps, it was ammonium and labeled
ammonium. Heavy water is sweet. However, o18 water is more plain
tasting than light water. Extrapolating, doubly labeled water has
effects nullifying itself. So, the labels with the most difference is
one with isotopes closer in weights (ND4) and one with isotopes
futher in weights (NhH4). Heaviest stable ammonium weight is 23 which
would be NhD4 (nitrogen-15 not Uut) which remove numbers is NhD like
national history day. The endermen decided to have a national history
day right after  </font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="ja-JP">矢澤にこ</span></font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">`s
birthday because it was so tragic that they have to take a day off to
comprehend history. So, 19 as in NhH4 and 22 as in ND4. 19 would be
the least sweet of the labels, and 22 would be the most sweet of the
labels. It might be the opposite because for sulfonium, the strength
is reversed, and ammonium might be more like sulfonium than water.
The difference in sweetness would correlate to difference in chemical
properties which means that the ion pumps would be less able to
confuse them. There is a problem that the hydrogen may switch with
another hydrogen on another molecule which would erase the gradient.
The heaviest and lightest labels are 18 and 23 which were my favorite
numbers when I briefly saw toxic pea in pvzgw1 because of critical
being 23 and direct being 18. Not even sure if I correctly remembered
the damage indicator. Make sense that it was toxic pea because
ammonia is toxic and light and doubly labeled ammonium would be toxic
to the alternative biology because less able to differentiate between
them. Out of all the toxic plants in pvzgw1, toxic pea is the most
iconic. However, not everywhere would have heavy nitrogen or
dueterium. So, the NhH4 and ND4 could be conditionally essential.
When there is an deficiency of hydrogen or dueterium, it could be
ammonium (any label) and sodium which sodium is 23. A reason why
sodium chloride should be the default salt is that one chlorine
isotope is 37 which would make some sodium chloride to be made of
weights 23 and 37. 23 and 37 are the first 2 primes that are not
paired. Cyclotomic field of 23 is the smallest field which class
number is not 1. Cyclotomic field of 37 is the smallest field which
field number is equal to the class number. Ammonium, labeled
ammonium, sodium pump would do 1-to-1 because they are so similar in
size.</font></font></p>

Erato asteriod is numbered 62 and is the muse of love peotry. I have
written in my twitter why 62 is connected to sora tokui. Also, venus
(sora tokui place on twitter, and is planet of love) year is (rounded
to the nearest hundredth) 0.62 earth years. Sora tokui is a girly
girl because venus symbol is girl. Venus year is 224.7 earth days. It
looks almost like 22.7 which is yazawa nico birthday (and related to
pi). rearrange the digits 2*(24+7) equals 62. 24 and 7 means day.
224.7 rounds to 225 which is 15^2. Another reason why 62 is love is
that Jesus said to love your nieghbors. It was from a fable about the
samaritian. Another neighbor (beside europium) of samarium is
promethium which is very radioactive. It is as dangerous as venus.
Like the endermen confused the light in the nether sky as heaven, the
soviets confused venus to be a friendly earth like planet. "nico
nico nii" may count as love peotry. Peotry is short. The most
notable short phrase from all of love live would be "nico nico

to be genetically close to jews. If europium is 63 and Shirai kuroko

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Some
humanoids tried to protect themselves by using immune system. They
are called volatile humanoids. The immune system had to use chemicals
that are more and more volatile. The volatile substances became
explosive. In order to prevent the humanoid from accidentally
exploding, the humanoid made 2 sacs for the volatiles. 1 sac is
smaller and contained very sensitive but not powerful explosive.
Another sac contained very powerful but not sensitive explosive. The
sensitive explosive is much better at complexing the strange matter.
The powerful explosive was very safe to store in large quantities.
Since it is powerful it means that it is energy dense, so it can make
multiple times the amount of the sensitive explosive. Sometimes there
is lots of red matter around, so the humanoid evolved to be made of
erectile tissue, so that the sensitive explosives can cycle many
times very fast over a really large surface area to complex any red
matter. The erectile tissue moves air instead of liquids because
liquids are heavy and biologically expensive. This makes a hissing
sound when the air is moved through small holes.  The erectile tissue
evolves to allow the sensitive explosive sac to cover the internal
organs which shortens the distance between the sac and the place of
irritation. This had a side effect of turning the sensitive explosive
sac into a implosive bomb which can pressurize the insides above
autoignition pressure. Eventually the red matter won and there is
nothing but a stupid brain. The mob is now a creeper. The side effect
became the main effect. When the creeper wants to explode, the
creeper stops to get all its muscle to work for a erections. Then a
hissing sound is made from the implosive sac traveling through air
filled tissue. The implosive sac gets around the secondary explosive
sac which needs the implosive sac to ignite. Some of the volatile
humanoid do not use lots of air and erections to get rid of red
matter. Getting rid of red matter with air and stuff is messy and the
red matter can turn from complexed to inorganic and come back to
destroy more. So the humaniod evolved to excrete waste that contains
complexed red matter into sticky white substances. It is designed to
stick and remain that way for a long time. The white sticky substance
decays slower in closed environments, so the spider evolved to have
lots of eyes to see in the dark. White sticky substances can be
disturbed when there are lots of others around, so the spider becomes
aggressive when there is no light. There isn't an evolutionary
advantage to be aggressive outside because the white sticky substance
would be quickly decaying no matter how many are around. The white
sticky substance evolved to be comfy cobwebs because the more
comfortable, the less likely it would be thrown out to decay into
inorganic red matter. The spider evolved to not fill their room with
waste so fast. So the spider becomes smaller. smaller means smaller
strides. To make up for the loss in speed, the spider evolved to have
more legs. There might be artificial lighting in the spider</font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="ja-JP">い</span></font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">s
room. To get a better way to tell the difference between inside and
outside, the spider evolved a black body to detect thermal radiation
that the sun emits. Unlike what others may theorize, the reason why
spiders are neutral during the day is not because the spiders are

humanoids used another way to get rid of red matter. They are called

that some effects do the opposite effect. But red matter got stronger
and the undeadness could not make the red matter do the opposite
effect. The humaniod lost its brain and became a zombie. Some undead
humanoids can use their undeadness to negate hunger. The undead
humaniods then evolved to close off points of failure. Closing off
also eliminated lots of flesh because flesh absorbs things. The 
undead humaniods still lose the brains because the red matter was
getting so strong, and they became skeletons.</font></font></p>

thinks that black sentence was jail sentence because the ghasts are

the blazes are built like the center of the blaze spawner is. A way

tells the ghast to design the spawner so that it is long lasting. So
some spawners were carried into the overworld so that it is protected

a mass of 97, and the room around them are red and the element named
after red is rhodium which has a mass of 103. 97 plus 103 is 200. 97

produced in the overworld, the spawners spawned zombies and
skeletons. Skeletons were chosen because they look like and attack
like blazes. Zombies were just flesh version of skeletons. The moss
is placed there to keep out red matter. Nether fortresses were built

pathway to intelligence is improbable to get to. Spawners decide to
train neural networks. Because heat in the spawners also destroy
neural networks and other extracellular structures even though the
slime brain cells themselves can survive the heat, the spawners need
to use blaze powder to save the neural network. So, the first slimes
were actually magma cubes. The magma cubes reproduced by teaching new
magma cube cells into a brain cell. Some magma cubes went to the
overworld which they turned into slimes because blaze powder cannot
be produced outside of the nether. The slimes are able to make slime
brains without having the brains devolve because the evolutionary
leap was already leaped. Slime brain cancer cells still beat out
normal slime brain cells, but evolution selects slimes without brain
cancer over slimes with brain cancer. The spawners also went to the
overworld. But, the spawners cannot spawn normal slimes because there
isn't a way around the fire resistance problem other than blaze
powder. </font></font>

sorting With tears in force.", tells them to create obsidian
pillars below ("With") them (tears in force). "...tears
in force" tells them that the combination should include ghast
tears which is "tears" and (which is "in") blaze
powder because blaze powder makes strength potions which strength is
force. The end crystal recipe has the ghast tear in the middle and
the blaze powdered ender pearl on the outside because "tears"
is the nominative. The rest of the chorus describes the ender dragon
instead of the end pillars. "Let's fly together until the dream
is visible." tells them to create the ender dragon which would
fly around the same place until their dream is visible. "I want
to be a dark despair Energy" tells the ender dragon to team up
with endermen. "Schwarzesmarken arms now!" tells the ender
dragon to choose the mig-23. Mig-23 is the flogger which is usually
black whips tied together. The reason why the the word "Energy"
was capitalized is so that the capitalised letters in the chorus that
is about the ender dragon spells 'Lies" which is close enough to
'Lise'. Another reason why 'Energy' is capitalized ('energy' and
'over-g' sound like they have shared suffix) is that it means the
opposite of 'Over-g'. This means that the ender dragon can fly
without worrying about getting damaged from accelerating too much.
The opposite of the prefix "Over-" is "inner-"
which makes the word "inner-g" which is spelled as
"Energy". Floggers as in whips, experience extreme amount
of g-force at its tips when used. However the amount is still inner-g
and not over-g because whips are made of strong material.</font></font></p>

ender dragon choose to have its eyes to have the same color as the
aerogel suits that the characters wear in schwarzesmarken. This is
because the ender dargon is analogous to the mig-23 therefore the
ender dragon eyes are analogous to the cockpit where you would see
the chracters in purple aerogel suits. All the endermen followed the

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">The
ender dragon is made of scandium because the both mig-21 and mig-23
are made of it. Not only that but the minecraft scandium is
scandium-44 and is not radioactive in minecraft. 21 plus 23 is 44
which is another reason to choose 44. 44th element is ruthenium which
means russia (russia is where the mig-21 and mig-23 originated from),
but the endermen does not know that because they count elements by
isobars. When endermen gets hit by the ender dragon, the endermen
feels a molecular weight of 44 which makes them think it is diatomic
element 22, and the endermen gets angry and remember Nico Yazawa\`s
birthday and attack the ender dragon. The endermen wasn't physically
hurt by the ender dragon.  Not related to minecraft theory: Sumipe is
33 and 33 is looks like 44, so that is why Sumipe should marry me. A
way that endermen can convergent derive the name scandium is from the
word "dragon scales". Don't wait for me to turn 22. If
scandium is radioactive in minecraft, then the endermen would think
to cleanse calcium-44 from themselves by eating strontium. The reason
why the red dragon does not exist is because since scandium-44 can be
made from the stellar alpha processes, it outnumbers scandium-45 by a
lot. The red dragon would be made of isotopically pure scandium-45
because the 45th element is rhodium which means "red". The
reason why the red dragon is weaker is because heavier isotope means
denser for the same strength which means less specific strength. To
accommodate the same load, scandium-45 would need to raise its
quantity to a power of 45/44 which can be a lot if the constants are
large. Scandium comes with aluminum, and al is 13th which is "two
souls-towards the truth-" which there are 2 of a lot of things: 
aluminum and scandium, mig-21 and mig-23, 10 and 21, red and ender,
scandium-44 and scandium-45, Eli Ayase and Yoshino Nanjou, diatomic,
love with you, and Jean. The ender dragon needs to hit the endermen
in order for the endermen to feel element 22 because 22nd mv is "love
with you". Scandium-aluminum alloy because the symbols
concatenate to scal which is substring of scale as in dragon scale
like ender dragon.</font></font></p>

reason why the enderdragon is made of scandium instead of

scandium-aluminium alloy which abbreviates to ScAl like dragon
scales. Black bullet b-side "pico scope -SACLA-" because

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Why
was the ender dragon named "Ender dragon" instead of "The
russian dragon", "Ruth the dragon named Jean", or
"dragon With tears in force" (capitalization in reference
to the chorus of the song "white forces"). It is because
the ender dragon is made of scandium which is the 21st element, and
the 21st mv in fripside infinite clip 2020 is "Edge of the
Universe" which suggest that it is the end. The ender dragon
update is the 10th minecraft beta update. 10th mv is black bullet
which also describes the ender dragon. (already written in the same
document a long time ago) 10 and 21 makes 10/21 which is Eli Ayase
birthday.  If the dragon was named after that, it could be "EA
dragon", "jEAn dragon" (the j and n stands for Yoshino
Nanjou. EA stands for Eli Ayase, Electronic Arts, and Effective
Altruism. On December 20 2024, vsauce released a #short video (with
an youtube id of Pv9HuVH9BbY ) which he said that the j in Jesus came
from a y in ancient languages. The reason why the dragon egg doesn't
hatch is because "jEAn is an eggbeater" (A reference to the
youtube video with id of Pv9HuVH9BbY ) Why is it "Eli Ayase and
Yoshino Nanjou" instead of "Eli Ayase as Yoshino Nanjou"?
because both Eli Ayase and Yoshino Nanjou is (signular tense) the
ender dragon. Ea nasir has EA and n follows. E in cyrillic is ye
which means that it is actually jean. He was selling copper which is
the lesbian element. Although poverty and technology would limit him
to just copper and bronze, he could have sold other thing which makes
it a coincidence.), "xopowo dragon","xbow wow dragon",
"quarter russian dragon"<span lang="en-US">, or "</span><span lang="ru-RU">Я</span><span lang="ru-RU">
</span><span lang="en-US">dragon"</span>. Actually the name of
the dragon is "9HuVH9BbY". The 2 letters before the name
was "Pv" which is abbreviation of "Player verses"
in english. It even has "Bb" in its name which stands for
"Black bullet" in english. "9Hu" and "VH9"
are copalindrome because "u" and "V" look
similar. It is 9 because black bullet is bigger than GUA-8. "Y"
because made of yttrium since scandium is so rare and yttrium is the
element that is the most like scandium because it is eke-scandium.</font></font></p>

<font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">Another
reason why it is red dragon and black dragon is that russia and china
are allies. Dragons in fairy tales come in red, black, and green.
Ender meaning ruthenium which means russia, and red dragon is
chinese. Since they are enemies to the protagonist and each other,
that means that minecraft is nato propoganda. Actually russia and
china are enemies because china scary and bigger than europe. Chinese
culture is incompatible with russian culture like censorship, death
penalty, atheism, anti-communism, vpns, and other stuff. So,
minecraft isn\`t nato propoganda, but it is the truth. Nato wants
people to believe that russia scary because china is russia\`s
friend.</font></font></p>

ender dragon also carries a end exit portal which it lays its eggs.
The dragon eggs teleport to  extreme hill biome because that is "high

is also a high stone because when the end generates, the exit portal
is placed above the highest block at 0,0. Even though the exit portal
doesn't spawn like it later version, the dragon usually flies high
which makes the exit portal to likely be high. The dragon eggs hatch
into silverfish just like mig-21 is a smaller version of mig-23, and

Infinity uses kinetic energy to produce infinity arrows. The infinity

music video is level5 judgelight. In a different text file, I have
wrote about that 2 connects to level5 because 2-ary logic can do
anything that 5-ary logic can. However 5-ary logic is confusing
because there are lots of different gates that takes 2 input and
return one output and is not easily converted back into 2-ary logic
since 5 is coprime to 2. The version is the 1st version to have code
obfuscation which is like programming in 5-ary logic. The b-side is
memory of snow. If it is obfuscated, the memory should be like snow.
It looks uniform from afar because of encryption. It actually

lava, and netherlands have similar etymology. It is also the world

it is also japan which the music is in. Truth is data. and the

ayase is the only UR. The UR symbol is a heart and color of rainbow
so it is regen rainbow. in btdb regen rainbow are r13 and are the
most famous bloon and round number. on round 13 live arena llsif, the
featured UR is #3032 eli ayase. #3032 skill effects are more unique
than any other skill effects because it is in person 5 style. The
attribute is cool and the skill is blue attendant which match the
btdb user interface color. 13 is a well known number because it is
the legal age of having a social media account. Coincidentally,
nanjolno won the influencer award on the 13th seiyuu award. It was
also the 1st time giving the award which coincide with age 13. There
were 10 URs from the persona 5 collab. 1 for each of the 9 muse and 1
for llsif live arena featured UR making the number of persona 5 eli
ayase UR to be 2. A coincidence with chess is that #3024 eli ayase
[which is from persona collab] is designed from penthesilea which is
an amazon queen. Amazon is the strongest piece in youtube chess
terminology which is the only type of fairy chess that matters. #3024
skill is Noble Steel Empress which has substring of empress which
empress is the same as chancellor in fairy chess. It is important
that it is empress because youtube chess terminology is backwards
compatible with capablanca chess where the strongest fairy chess
piece is chancellor, and chancellor is mentioned in the bitcoin
genesis block, and nanjolno is satoshi nakamoto. So #3024 is the
strongest chess piece in both capablanca chess and youtube chess
terminology.</font></font></p>

round 18 live arena llsif, it was a collab with code geass.
Coincidentally, chess is relevant in code geass. The featured UR is
#3327 chika takami. Chika takami is flat like an aerodynamic blimp
called moab. The moab is on round 18 and is also very famous because
it is the first round when moab-class bloons could be sent. 18 is a
well known number because it is the age of adulthood. The moab pops
into 4 ceramics. The ceramic texture when damage is partially a
rainbow. Therefore, the rainbow should be counted which another
reason is that 8 and 18 ryhme. Another reason is that round 18 is
when fast cooldown ceramics could be sent which inside are rainbow.
There are 8 rainbows in a moab which is like there being 8 orange
tissues in the chika takami symbol, and there are 8 other love live
sunshiners.</font></font></p>

idea in memory of fisher is nazi chess. It is fisher random except
the white queen is replaced with chancellor which is  0.5 point less
than queen. This balences the odds for black in 960. It is nazi
because the country with chancellor attacked first. Nighted queen is
nepotist. So, nighted queen is nepotist or amazon or penthesilae, and
queen+nightrider is dickrider or penthesilae. empress is
chancellor+king. bishop and knightrider is pope. It should be named
empress because would be as valuble as queen. that means that add ess
to move like king. If the leaper is turned into rider then it would
be amazon. so from lowest value to highest: pawn, knight, bishop,
king, rook, knightrider, bishopess, dame, archbishop, archbishopess,
chancellor, queen, empress, pope, popess (or papess, bloone, peepo,
people), penthesilae, dickrider. Excluding, camo, zebra, regen,
rainbow, and rider version and combination of the. fortified meaning

unqueened. so it applies to septhesilae and octhesilae. queen +

Written when irish holiday is around in 2025. So it is said that a
pot of gold is at the end of a rainbow. Given that the hierarchy of
metals is gold, silver, and bronze. Given that the hierarchy of
bloons are BAD/Round 1336 in BTD5, of the blimp-less DC 'Rainbow Rush
of Doom' , ZOMG/DDT, BFB, MOAB, ceramic, rainbow, zebra, lead,
white/bmc white/black/purple, pink, yellow, green, blue, red. Since
rainbow is matched with gold. Why it starts with rainbows? because
the strongest blimp is from Rainbow Rush of Doom. Then at the end of
a zebra is a pot of silver which makes sense because silver is a
combination of white and black. At the end of a lead is a pot of
bronze which makes sense because full metal jacket is bronze covering
lead. The jacket is shaped like a pot and is made of bronze. It is
also why fmj upgrade allows snipers to destroy lead bloons because a
pot of bronze ends lead as a pun. Bronze is copper and tin. Stannum
etymology is sliver and lead. So that is that is why a pot of bronze
has lead. Ak-47 is the most famous gun. 47 is silver which is why
tin. Fmj is the most famous type of bullet. Point-five-oh is 7 layer
damage because it is 12.7 in metric and 7 is the number after the
point. Deadly precision is 18 because 18 is grown up. To pop a moab
into rainbows like Takami Chika's symbol and do the upgrade before
it, you need 21 damage because need to deal 210 damage without doing
less than 11 damage at once and do more than 17 damage at once. That
number is 21 which is the drinking age of usa which was also the
voting age of usa before veitnam war. Why does 12.7 turn rainbows
into red? The end of a rainbow is gold which rubber to gold is
depicted as red turn to gold (red and gold is also a famous phrase),
so it is rainbows to red. 12.7 is used because there are 7 colors of
the rainbow. Fmj turns both  zebra and leads to greens. Fmj is used
because bronze also contains silver in etymology. Green because the
end of lead on the periodic table is thallium because radioactive
lead decays to thallium. Thallium etymology is "green shoots".
Shoots is a homonym in english which one definition means to use a
gun. Another reason why 12.7 is used on rainbows is that 12.7 is
nanjolno birthday which means that it is nanjolno. rainbows come from
DC 'Rainbow Rush of Doom' which in btdb is 'Regen Raibow Rush of
Doom' which is on round 13. Round 13 in live arena has featured UR
Eli Ayase. Eli Ayase is  blonde because the only real UR is is Eli
Ayase which can be abbreviated to UREA which makes pee and pee is
yellow. And fmj pops rainbows into yellows. Why does fmj do 4 damage?
Because silver is in both bronze and silver. Silver number is 47 as
written before. 4 means 4 damage. 7 means 7 damage which is already
assigned. Deadly precision and cripple moab pops moab into blues
which blues are coincidentally the same color as moab. Ak-47 is
written on the 47th (not anymore) page of minecraft theory using
default page settings in libre writter. Why 21 damage for turning
moab into rainbows? because 12.7 and  47. 7 is removed because period
means to seperate them. In 12.7 and 47, 12 is 3 times 4. So it left
with 3, and 3 times 7 is 21. Takami Chika can be abbreviated to TC
which in Cyrillic would be the same abbreviation as tsukuyomi
shirabe. Takami Chika in palinov system is TT because Chi is treated
the same as ti. TT as in tech terror which is the btdb equivalent of
tsukuyomi shirabe. If it is cyrillic, then TC also stands for
tsukuyomi shirabe. Not only aqours orange girl is a reference to
nanjolno, but also in toaru because only my railgun (brown hair is
close enough to orange), fripside logo, code geass chess, and in M's
because Kousaka Honoka the orange hair girl has initials of KH which
in romanization of cyrillic is <span lang="ru-RU">Х </span><span lang="en-US">as
in </span><span lang="ru-RU">хорошо</span><span lang="en-US">
which is eli ayase's favorite word</span>. Honoka also sounds like
hanaka which is a jewish holiday. Trump (orange hair man) is also a
reference to nanjolno because nanjolno will beat trump in the next
presidential election. Nanjolno is satoshi nakamoto which bitcoin has
orange logo. Rainbows get shot into reds and yellows. Red and yellow
combine to make orange. There are no indium bullets in bloons because
14.5⨯114 doesn't exist in upgrades. However, there might be,
because the base sniper does 2 damage which is blue bloon health.
Indium etymology is blue. So the bullet is made of indium. Indium
stable isotopes in equiprobability is 114 in weight. 14.5 is
connected to gallium, and indium is connected to gallium because they
make low melting point alloy. Thallium is also connected because
poison and bullets are things that kill people. Koizumi Hanayo also
abbreviates to KH which is <span lang="ru-RU">Х</span><span lang="en-US">.</span><span lang="en-US">
Indium bullet caliber would be 4.54 because the natrual abundance of
in-113 is 4.29 percent which is about abundance of pure substance
after 4.54 halflives.</span><span lang="en-US"> </span><span lang="en-US">Actually,
they are both very close together. Solving the equation
\\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{x_{solve}}=\frac{x_{solve}}{100} gives
x_{solve} equal to 4.48027 which is pretty close to 4.48, so the
caliber is 4.48 . </span><span lang="en-US">Thallium-205 abundance is
70.476 percent which is the about the abundance of pure substance
after 0.50 halflives. Just like point-five-oh is very deadly. It is a
little more than 0.50 halflives like real point-five-oh bullets are
more like 0.51 .</span><span lang="en-US"> On the contrary of skulls,
black bullet is the strongest because fripside and blue bullet is the
weakest.</span><span lang="en-US"> Also indium bullet because
antimony is in bullets which antimony is close to indium on the

More reason why nanjolno owns love live. Eli Ayase initials are EA
just like electronic arts. That means that like 99% of the profit
goes to nanjolno and all the other love live seiyuus are underpaid.
Many love live fans point out that nanjolno dis the love live staff
during podcasts. However, to believe that love live staff would allow
nanjolno to do that would be as believable as talking to the police
during interrogation so that you would be left out early. Instead,
nanjolno was doing reverse psychology to make people believe that
nanjolno was the victim. Nanjolno was the only seiyuu that talked
about why M's disbanded. The lack of public appearances after
disbanded is due to the fact that for nanjolno winning the game that
she rigged is not fun. An even more facty fact is that gokinjolno
mailed pictures of eli ayase to subscribers. There is no way that
love live staff would have allowed that unless nanjolno was their
majority investor.</font></font></p>

80 sappho. 85 io. 83 beatrix. 80 sappho etymology is a girl on

antimony, tungsten, and mercury. Orange girl in M's is voiced by
seiyuu born in 1985. 85 as in io. But io is in klio. So, orange girl
who is the leader is really nanjolno which makes sense because
nanjolno is the majority investor in love live franchise. 83 beatrix
is a love. I have written about why I believe that shikaco's brother
was born on feburary 9, 1983. So the coincidence that is 83 means
that nanjolno did have sex with shikaco's brother.</font></font></p>

nanjolno and uesaka sumire married on december 19, 2009. A reason why
nanjolno and uesaka  sumire should marry is that their birth years
are 7 years apart. 7 is lucky. Nanjolno and uesaka sumire could have
married in the usa much earlier. If nanjolno marry uesaka sumire on
her 18th birthday, nanjolno would be 25, and uesaka sumire would be
18. 25 is age of independence in us. However, that coincidence could
just be that 25 is a round number. I checked nanjolno blog. There is
a large time gap for nanjolno and uesaka sumire to fly to east coast
of united states and marry. 18p 25n on the periodic table is argon-43
which decays to calcium-43 which is the reverse of bone ar-gon. That
means that nanjolno and uesaka sumire can have sex because of bone.
Ar to Ca. Ti to Cr. Ca and Cr are the final products. The 2nd letters
are A and R which makes Ar. R and I makes RI which ANSI is 44 like
Ruthenium. A and T makes At like nanjolno name at birth. RI etymology
is red which is same etymology as element 45. East coast because more
time before the next day starts. Connecticut, vermont, and
massachusetts were where marriage licenses were avalible. Nanjolno
and uesaka sumire can connect together in connecticut. Washington
D.C. legalized same sex marriage on december 18, 2009 which would
haven been uesaka sumire's 18th birthday in japan time zone. The law
did not come in effect until march 9, 2010 after a waiting period.
March 9 not because of my birthday, but because of molotov's
birthday. Uesaka sumire must have been really excited because of that
coincidence. Another coincidence is that wikipedia's balletopedia
source on washington d.c. was written on july 12, 2009 which is
nanjolno's 25th birthday. The washington d.c. coincidence shows that
nanjolno and uesaka sumire will become president and vice president
in 2029. Not only nanjolno and uesaka sumire married, but also maybe
the relationship was upgraded from child and adopter. Nanjolno can
adopt uesaka sumire in July 12, 2002 which is when uesaka sumire
would be 10 years old. 10 and 18 just like 10th and 18th seiyuu
awards. 10p 18n is neon-28 which decay probability are 84% and 16%.
84 because 1984. 16 because 16th mv is a collab. Even though can't
marry adopted child, nanjolno and sumipe could live out their
adoption fantasy using notary forms, so adoption without adopting.
Another reason to marry in connecticut is that the abbreviation is CT
like contested territory in monkey city. CT backwards is Tc which is
element 43 and 43 as in calcium-43. When nanjolno and uesaka sumire
marry in japan, their total age would be 52 like Cr-52, and 52 is Te
which coincidentally, is the next element to start with "t"
after Tc.  Tc as in nanjolno will be the 43rd elected president, and
nanjolno voices tsukuyomi shirabe. CT is alphabetically followed by
DC. The ANSI numbers are 9 and 11 like 9/11. DCAS  as in nanjolno in
DC1. The ANSI numbers of DC and AS are 11 and 60 which adds to 71
which copalindrome with 17 which 17 in ascii is DC1. If you cut off
DCAS to DCA as if to make it not plural in english grammar, it would
be DC and CA which ANSI numbers adds to 17. I finally found why it is
Alternate Seasons and not Winter Arc. Why else 43? 43 is the fourth
number to be skipped on ANSI. The other 4 skipped are 3,7,14, and 52
which 14 and 52 elements spell out NSI. An "A" is added to
the front to be "anti-". So, ANSI means anti-"nitrogen
and silicon". 3 and 52 have in common that their etymology is
earth. A conspiracy theory you can make is that the coast guard
operated the particle collider to create californium because element
98 is Cf which matches USCG code. A reason to chose massachusetts is
that its ANSI code is 25 like what age nanjolno would have been.
Minnesota is abbreviated to the same as manganese but its ansi code
is 27. In nanjolno's yoshino712 blog, the 2 post around uesaka
sumire's 18 birthday were on the 18th and 25th day. It is another
coincidence that shows that nanjolno married uesaka sumire.  Nanjolno
may have wanted to marry uesaka sumire because uesaka sumire became a
fan of the soviet union by herself and never knew about nanjolno
liking soviet union or anything like that. Another reason to marry in
massachusetts is that the USCG state abbreviation is MS which is
misawa sachika's initials. Misawa sachika will have had a fake
marriage with uesaka sumire. USCG has 2 incompatible codes to iso
3166 which are MS and MI. Mississippi is both of them. The other
codes are either match or disjoint. Another reason why when uesaka
sumire becomes president of the united states, uesaka sumire would
chose sakura ayane as vice president is that their fake husbands are
misawa sachika and minase inori which intials are MS and MI. If it
was DCWA that would be 11 and 53 which add to 64 which is close to 62
as in s62, and it is related because DC1 is the earliest in original
work release.</font></font></p>

i remember that when i was little. I heard that gay marriage is
getting legalized. I thought that it was bad because it is promoting
marriage which is bad. I thought it is like corporate protecting the
existence of corporatism by banning segregation. It is more freedom
to the workers, but just continues the cycle of corporatism. I would
have compared it to rainbow capitalism if I knew more stuff back
then. I wanted marriage to be gone because before I knew about gay
rights and stuff, I knew marriage as a thing that ruins peoples
lives. I knew about large cost, stressful "best day", being
trapped in years of debt, someone taking half your stuff, and other
things. So, I thought that we shouldn't be expanding marriage, but
abolishing marriage. But soon, I thought and concluded that gay
marriage have a lot less problems that straight marriage have. So, I
concluded that only gay marriage should be allowed. But, it wasn't a
strong belief. Now, it is a stronger belief. Straight marriages are
really problematic and should be abolished. Only gay marriages should
exist. People who do straight marriages are mostly people who want
money or lust, and other downsides of straight marriage. I get really
butt hurt when I learn about seiyuus getting married to a guy. But, I
do wish straight marriage to the seiyuus I dislike. It is futile
because my favorite seiyuu can just get a boyfriend.</font></font></p>

I have written in 2022, that nanjolno lied about how satoshi yaginuma
scouted her. I believed that it was nanjolno that asked instead of
the other way around. A reason is that satoshi has the same first
name as satoshi nakamoto. And, nakamoto and yaginuma initials would
be NY like nanjou yoshino. Another reason is that the video seems to
be taken down even though there are many videos from the same
copyright holder that seem to be up. However, now, I think the
opposite. Using concepts like detecting reverse psychology, I believe
that satoshi yaginuma asked nanjolno to be in fripside. It was months
after nanjolno invented bitcoin, so there was no taking back bitcoin.
Nanjolno rejected many times because nanjolno does not want to be
found out to be satoshi nakamoto. But, satoshi yaginuma insisted.
Nanjolno may thought that if she rejects, it will be known and even
bigger suspicion fall on why nanjolno would reject such a good offer.</font></font></p>

Tantalum abundance is suppose to be about being the rarest isotope

Gallium isotope is not 69/31 nor 420/580. Just like gallium needs to
coincide with guns because 14*5 is 70, gallium is coincided to guns
but in video game. Gallium isotope is around 60.1/39.9 which means
that good game design should make the largest bullet do at most 60%
of health. If there is a rounding error, then round to benefit the
bullet because there should also be natural regeneration that should
cover it. The biggest machine gun would be the GAU-8 avenger. 37mm
autocannons shoot too slow to count. GAU has U because it shoots
depleted uranium. Ga stands for gallium, so gallium is should be
about the largest bullet. Indium is about the smallest bullet.
Thallium is even smaller being poison. Nihonium is really small like
the abundance of heavy nitrogen is about 1 in number of amus in
nihonium. On the opposite side, aluminium is larger than gallium
because aluminium is about rockets and not bullets. Rocket is mostly
fuel like boron. Boron isotope abundance follows the closest to 80/20
rule which is the idea that small things do most of the work like the
payload does most of the work, and payload is really small. Another
reason why to chose abundance of Ga69 as damage is that GAU-8 30mm is
rated as 69mm RHA penetration which there is 69 in 69mm, and
"penetration" sounds gay like gallium yttrium in english.
Another reason why 69mm is that 115mm is exactly 69mm/0.6 but 69/0.4
is an ugly number. 115 as in moscovium which is where stalin lives.
So, stalinium is 115mm of RHA. 172.5 would be the average of
ytterbium equiprobable weight and ytterbium atomic weight.

It is lithium and carbon because they are both related. The natural

In world building, metals bond to oxygen. To get pure metals, you

to be water insoluble to prevent a runaway reaction. Lanthanum is the
most reductive which has insoluble oxides. Purity of things is
measured in how many 9s there are. Lanthanum abundance is closest to

So, I had written about love live fans choosing Umi Sonoda as the
most lesbian character. However, they were right. Umi Sonoda
etymology is unknown sea and rice garden. Asteroid 29 is the sea
goddess and also a wife of the sea god. Sea like umi. Asteroid 35 is
Leukothea which correspond to number of nuetrons in equiprobable
copper was a goddess of sea. Leukothea changed name to Ino. Ino like
Inorin like Mimo is shipping name of mimorin as in Mimojolks. Also
inorin and mimorin because their initials are MS and MI which are
abbreviations of Mississippi in ISO 3166 and USCG and are the only
keyvalues that are incomptible in between ISO 3166 and USCG. Mimorin
is umi sonoda va and changed her name before. Rin meaning that the
rin hoshizora va got married. Asteroid 36, which 36 as in already
written to compare krypton to mimorin, is Atalante. It sounds like
Atlantis which went into the sea. Atalante early life was getting
kicked out and being raised by hunters. Mimorin grew up in a
all-girls highschool. The comparison isn't that close, but
specialization is in both. Atalante used bow after being beautiful to
kill 2 centurions Rhoecus and Hylaios who tried to rape her. I can
only connect Rhoecus to awatsuki maaya. Hylaios means "wooded"
like lesbos etymology. Umi Sonoda\` symbol is bow. Atalante was also
good at wrestling because she won a wrestling match. Mimorin also
likes wrestling. Atalante does stuff that requires going outside a
lot. Mimorin also likes outside. During the Calydonian boar hunt,
Atalante was so beautiful that Meleager wanted to marry her and gave
the prize to her. It is like mimorin being popular with other seiyuus
and her classmates in highschool. Atalante symbol is the golden
apple. Her husband won her by dropping golden apples. Umi etymology
is sea. Mimorin's husband's nickname is rainmaker which etymology is
dropping water. Atalante and her husband were turned into lions
during their first intercourse in a sanctuary of zeus (who is the
father of muse). Zeus is not so coincidental because zeus appears a
lot. They became lions so they can love each other outside of the
society that would not accept their relationship. It is just like
mimorin and okada love each other even though mimorin's fans would
not ship mimokada. Mimorin being atalante is the most cannon out of
all other comparisons between people and greek mythology. They get
turned into lions because ukraine symbol is the lion which the 1st 2
μ\`s that got married were blue and yellow. Atalante\`s husband is
Hippomenes who got help from aphrodite which is the goddess of love.
The muse of love is Nico Yazawa. Before μ\`s disbanded (so at lease
6 years before okada's marriage), okada appeared in a photo with all
of μ\`s seiyuus which he was standing adjacent to only Sora Tokui
and putting his hand on Sora Tokui's shoulder. One of the apple that
Hippomenes dropped was from cyprus which is the island that copper
was named after.</font></font></p>

because they are poisons. Equiprobable weight of Eke-element 33 is
122 which december 2 is when inorin is born. Asteroid 39 is the

honesty. 37 being rubidium which is about the opposite of bromine.
Faith, oath, and honesty is needed to give gifts without bromide.
Gallium-69 has 38 nuetrons which asteroid 38 is leda which sounds

lead. Asteroid 18 is muse of tragedy because argon sounds like "are
gone" and endermen cannot get argon-36. Asteroid 5 is asterea
which is goddess of purity like how britains believed that adding
boron to milk makes milk pure which is also a reason to name milky
holmes. Milky holmes has 5 main characters because Kokoro Akechi
counts. Asterea → asteroid, milk→galaxy. Asteroid 24 is goddess
of law just like to have marriage be recognized requires there to be
law. Asteriod 6 is goddess of eternal youth, prime of life, and
forgiveness which carbon is the organic atom. Asteroid 21 is lutecia
which is a capital like how the enderdragon is the only thing that is
made of element 21 and is the final boss. Lutecia is same etymology

enderdragon is also connected. 71 juche is 1982 which is one off like
schwarzesmarken and 1984. 71 is number of neutrons in equiprobable
antimony. 70 because Yb looks like Sb S-[opposite]&gt;N-[opposite]&gt;Y
72 because it is Hf which is abbreviation of hydrofluoric acid. Sb
with HF because strongest acid is fluoroantimonic acid.</font></font></p>

There is a movie called wonder women 1984. W is element 74, but the
title is ww84. Just like x86, but Os (which stands for operating
system) is element 76. Both the atomic numbers are exactly 10 less
than their counterparts. The real reason why it is named 1984 is the
W184 (remove the 9) has density which is indistinguishable (exactly
the same significant digits. less than 0.2% error. closest density of
stable isotope to gold) from gold (monoisotope). In ww84, the
protagonist wears gold armor. Regan was president and regan was
relected in 1984 which he was the president who tried to get us back
on gold standard. Even more coincidence is that gold's melting point
is 1948 fahrenheit. Gold's price a few years ago was 1984 dollars per
ounce which is 69984 dollars per ounce. (ends in '984') 1968 dollars
per ounce is the closest to 69420 dollars per kg. 1984 dollars per
ounce is the most coincidental, so the us should deflate to get gold
to 1984 dollars per ounce. 1948 is also exaclty 100 less than 2^11.
Titanium-gold because 2*11 is 22. Many people compare titanium to
tungsten and want titanium-gold intermetallic. Nanjolno will be 48th
president. (1948 is '48) The dollars pegged to 1984th of an ounce of
gold would be called jolusd like how kusd (which sounds like kussun)
is 1000 usd. In 2048, nanjolno would be 64 because 1984 is already
close to a power of 2 in prime factors. 64 as in amount of minecraft
gold you can stack before you need another stack which is same with
almost all items. Tungsten is 74, gold is 79, the next arithmetic
progression is 84. The production of silver to gold ratio is about 10
to 1, but the price is about 90 to 1. It could be dropped down to an
kilogram to an ounce because 35 is between 10 and 90. Coincidentally,
when fort knox was created, gold was 35 usd per ounce. So, silver
should be pegged to 1984 usd per kilogram. Another reason why
nanjolno is born on the 194th day is that 1984 remove 8 to get 194.
December 7 was 342nd day which doesn't have the coincidence. December
7 is also in the wrong order with the product and bigger number in

not a big number, and the first way back page archived was in april
30, 2008. Tokui sora may have known all that and about satoshi
nakamoto's whitepaper because cryptocurrencies are also an interest
of people who like anime. When, satoshi nakamoto released bitcoin,
tokui sora must have recognized the 103 in January 3rd, so tokui sora
contacted nanjolno to let nanjolno know about it. Since the 2nd block
was mined on january 9th. Either nanjolno responded really quickly to
tokui sora, or the evidence of mining after the 1st block was deleted
(if nanjolno detect that only nanjolno and her bots were mining, then
it would be easy to get away with that), or nanjolno had already
planned to stop on the first block. Another reason why tokui sora and
nanjolno ship is cannon is that the nicoeli ur pair is 2591 and 2592.
2591 is 1592 with first and last digits switched. The reason why it
isn't 2951 (is 13*227 which 227 is nico birthday which is more
coincidental than prime number) is that ur pairs are adjacent in
numbers. 2592 is 1^6*2^5*3^4 (decreasing and increasing) which looks
like 1^6*3^4*5^2 or 1^6*3^4*5^2*7^0 (decreasing evens and increasing
odds) other formulas that produce pretty looking numbers are
\prod_{n=0}^{x}\left(2x+1-n\right)^{n}\n\left(\prod_{n=0}^{x-1}\left(x-n\right)^{n}\right)\n\prod_{n=0}^{x}\left(n+1\right)^{\left(x-n\right)}
formulas that hit 0^number are 0. Most are very big or very small.
Intresting results are 5^{0}\cdot4^{1}\cdot3^{2}\cdot2^{3}\cdot1^{4}
or 4^{1}\cdot3^{2}\cdot2^{3}\cdot1^{4} which is 288.
7^{0}\cdot6^{1}\cdot5^{2}\cdot4^{3} which is 9600. it is too round.
6^{1}\cdot4^{3}\cdot2^{5} is 12288 which is almost too big. But, 2952
and 2025 are the most interesting. It seems that nicoeli card was
purposefully added by nanjolno or soramaru at those numbers to show
nanjolno and soramaru being cannon.</font></font></p>

The satoshi nakamoto and hal finny coincidence seems to be planted by
nanjolno. Nanjolno found that around hal finny was a person who
changed his name away from satoshi. Nanjolno believe that such
coincidence would take suspicion off elsewhere, and people would fall
for reverse psychology believing that a person would hide behind a
name that they previously had. Another coincidence that nanjolno may
have been trying to plant is that hal finny initials are hf which is
hydrofluoric acid. Hydrofluoric acid and stibium creates the
strongest acid, fluoroantimonic acid, which stibium is next to
stannum. Stannum is sn which is the intials of satoshi nakamoto. When
soramaru informed nanjolno about nanjolno being satoshi nakamoto,
nanjolno might have let soramaru join her because soramaru and
nanjolno is sn like satoshi nakamoto. Stannum is element 50 which
asteroid 50 is virginia which is a story about a guy protecting his
duaghter's virginity by killing her. The coincidence may have made
nanjolno and soramaru not tell any boys which implies that both of
them had boyfriends back then. This was before love live even
existed! It is so sad to know that nanjolno and soramaru had
boyfriends and no virginity for so long. Although, virginia is not
the 50th state, its allusion to the USA coincide with 50 states.
There wasn't even 50 states when the asteroid was named. Hal finny
was not the one who used hal finny's email to send to satoshi
nakamoto. The 1st message was sent by nanjolno who hacked hal finny's
email. Nanjolno expected hal finny to react as if he never sent the
email. Hal finny's reaction would create reverse psychology which
would make people believe that hal finny messed up his opsec and is
cleaning up by denying that he had anything to do with bitcoin.
However, hal finny had ALS which made him have memory problems and
believed that he actually sent the email. Dorian nakamoto was also a
good target because dorian nakamoto worked in top secret clearance. A
bigger reverse psychology effect than bitcoin being created by secret
agent would be that dorian nakamoto would say "I cannot disclose
information" while believing that the press was asking him about
his government work. (which he did do that on the news) Then, he
would say that he thought the press was asking him about the us
government and not bitcoin. The reverse psychology victims would
believe that dorian nakamoto was just cleverly covering up.</font></font></p>

Why is the 3 letter abbreviation of USSR SUN? Sun is the brightest
thing in the sky which means power. The brightest planet and 3rd
brightes object in the sky is venus which is Tokui sora's favorite
planet and other things written before. Nozomi toujou is shipped with
nico yazawa because nozomi toujou symbol is moon which is the 2nd
brightest object in the sky. Tokui sora means sky power. That means
that Nanjolno is not russia even though nanjolno's character in love
live is russian. It is sora tokui that is russia and soviet union.
Nanjolno and Uesaka Sumire are alike because they are used to
represent russia, but they actually represent the USA. Another reason
why is that it is SU then SUN in iso 3166 alpha 3. S is begining of 2
letter code and N is added. SN means soramaru but the "m"
lost a leg. u and n in SUN can be concatenated to M. Also, it has
substring UN which means that it is the most powerful. A reason to
argue that judit polgar is more chess than magnus carlsen is that her
country's 3 letter code which is hungary also has substring UN.
Unlike soviet union, hungary doesn't have many grandmasters which
make it more statistically significant. Another reason why sora tokui
and soviet union is that soviet union died on sora tokui's birthday.
It is the 360th day of the year which 360 means circle which means
shekel that has smile like nico nico nii. Soviet union collapsed on
1991 because european union is abbreviated as eu which in iupac
temporary element abbreviation is element 91. Many parts of the
soviet union joined the european union and all of soviet union is in
europe. 1991 is also a palindrome. A reason why circle is that it has
the same etymology as "kike". Star represents communism
like soviet union 3 letter abbreviation.</font></font></p>

Soramaru and nanjolno were cannon way before love live existed.
Soramaru choose pink because soramaru is coping that she is ugly in
real life. Nanjolno chose light blue because it is israel flag. Both
soramaru and nanjolno are satoshi nakamoto. Soramaru chose angley as
her vtuber name because s concatenated to a is sa which is the
hiragana in satoshi. Satoshi nakamoto is a programmer. Pink and light
blue from μ\`s makes trangender flag. Programming socks are
transgender flag without the white. Therefore, soramaru and nanjolno
invented programming socks before they were a thing. Eli ayase was
derived from EC and clio. Satoshi nakamoto created the 1st block
which cannot be signed with built-in algorithm, but signed with an
algorithm written by someone who knows a lot about EC. Nanjolno is
also Cleo in stackexchange who was famous for answering questions
without showing work. Clio-[devoice]&gt;Cleo. Soramaru and Nanjolno
are only 1 of 2 pairs of μ\`s who share the same year and subunit.
The other is kotohono. It is orange and grey. Grey as in the white in
the transgender flag. Grey as in white and orange as in the color of
ubuntu which is the most famous linux distro. Like reality is
stranger than fiction, nanjolno and soramaru is stranger than
fanfiction. It better be true because soramaru better not have been
married to anyone other than Aina Kusuda. Marrying to nanjolno would
be bad opsec.</font></font></p>

What would minecraft theory without soramaru be like? Only the nickle
series of all the elements would be written. There would still be
stuff from the first minecraft theory. Fripside and comparing mvs to
version numbers would be mentioned. I had wanted to complete the
minecraft theory 2024 since april 2024, but I procrastinated until
december. There would be more focus on updates like 1.2 full release
and stuff. There would be  muons, uv catastrophe, piglins being μ\`s,
tauons (which was the reason why I decided to make a minecraft theory
2. It was also light blue nijigasaki birthday when I realized it),
cyclotomic 23, 1.8 full release (planning to write that tauons give
admins more power, but forgot). If soramaru had not marry, I probably
would have overlooked lots of things in my minecraft theory.
Soramaru's marriage made me write about my minecraft theory in much
better quality. Marriage is love which is the reason why nico yazawa
is the muse of love. Before, soramaru announced her marriage, I
thought soramaru is a side character and is the ugliest μ\`s. But,
after soramaru announced her marriage, I got jealous which made me
think that soramaru is pretty. I got a new fetish. I was also sad,
angry, and coping. Soramaru lived in my head which made me wrote
about her in my minecraft theory. Before I concluded that me and
nanjolno should be together because I watched milky holmes, I thought
nanjolno was the 2nd ugliest  μ\`s. I tried to not let nanjolno's
personality (as in anything other than looks) affect my judgement of
her prettyness, but I slowly started to think that nanjolno was the
prettiest girl that ever existed and could ever exist. </font></font>

Nanjou means "south strip". That strip could mean land as
in south korea just like 711 was renamed from "southland ice".
(written in github) "Southland" having the same meaning as
"nanjou", and "ice" having the same sound as
"Aino". Assuming that one side of nanjolno family came from
soviet union, that side would have to go through north korea. During
ww2, the soviet forcibly deport many koreans from UzSSR to north
korea. A soviet couple may have known about it, and believed that
going to north korea was a way to escape. Soviet citizens could
easily escape by east berlin before 1962, and going on vacation after
1982. That makes between 1962 and 1982 to be the years that going to
north korea to make sense. A reason to escape by north korea is that
they escaped through the berlin wall, but were unwelcomed by the west
germans, so they went back to soviet union to escape by north korea.
Another reason is that they escaped to alaska, but were also
unwelcomed. Before going back from either west germany, west berlin,
or alaska, they might buy korean and japanese esl textbooks because
there might not be good quality ones in soviet union. Another reason
is that after they escaped to west germany, west berlin, or alaska,
they read that japan is having big economy growth, so they decide
that it was easy to go to japan by north korea. Another reason is
that they do not want to identify themselves as escapees because they
know that escapees are treated badly, but they read that south korea
treats north korean escapees as south korea citizens, so they go back
to go to north korea. The soviet couple would study korean. Then,
they would lie about being ethnic koreans that were trapped in the
soviet union. They would chose the last name "nanjou" which
secretly means south korea and japan. They would justify choosing a
japanese last name by saying that they were displaced by the japanese
in ww2 and had to chose a japanese name. They would get to immigrate
to north korea and get north korean citizenship immediately. They
would go to south korea through the dmz and get south korean
citizenship immediately. Then, they lived the rest of their lives in
japan by south korean visa.</font></font></p>

that means that the events in 1911 would have to be changed because
2040 is 129 juche which minus 128 would not be negative. Therefore,
2036 is the last leap year to skip leap day, so 2036 is important to
north korea.  2036 is juche 125 which the current calendar is mod
125. Python time module is pytime which pyt is pyongyang time zone.
Juche was named after a person born after leap day on juche 1, so
2040 is actually the real last year to change to mod 128. 2040 is
juche 129 which is a fake fermat prime. 2044 is juche 133 which
cs-133 is used to keep time. 2048 is a power of 2 like 128 which is
the reason why many people want 2048 to be skipped. 2048 is juche 137

Nihonium is the 1 of 2 element named after japan which the other is

Nozomi Tojo va is Aina kusuda. Aina Kusuda fan club is named kususapo
which sounds like gestapo. I named Emperor Showa supporters as
showasapo which is not a coincidence because I took inspiration from
kususapo and gestapo. Aina Kusuda and Nanjolno should announce their
run for prime minister of japan and president of the united states
together because they are shipped as jolks. Hideki Toujou was
secretly communist. The soviet union was founded on his 38th
birthday. 1884 is a communist year to be born because 1984 book got
its name from 1884. Hideki Toujou was executed alongside all the
other communists in the IMTFE. Nozomi tojo color is purple like the
japanese ww2 encryption name and soviet cold war encryption name. It
was a encryption method that the OSS pretended to have cracked in
order to cover up hirohito's traitorous actions of leaking japanese
military secrets to the OSS during ww2. Nanjolno should be president
of united states. Aina Kusuda should be prime minister of japan. Sora
Tokui should be supreme leader of russia or whatever is russia's
successor. They are all of the 3rd years muse. 3rd years muse has one

Science fantasy idea. All atoms have infinite electrons. The nucleus
has infinite positive charge. The leptons have finite charge The high
binding energy as the electron shells go down get higher and higher
which is negative energy to balance the positive rest mass of the
electron. The nucleus is infinitely small like the smallness of the
electrons. That means that atoms act like gluons. The harder you
pull, you would create new electrons. The only antimatter is positron
and anti-leptons. No nuclear fusion or fission or neutronium is
possible. Atoms are defined by their electron shells and mass. Atoms
could have electron shells that are completely different from each
other. Some atoms have a valence shell with a total of 1/2,1,2, or
any positive number spots instead of 8 that real life valence shells
have. Electric force is modified so that it drops faster than inverse
squared at long distance and increase very slow at small distances.
All leptons are stable. All leptons other than electron have a radius
which prevents them from sinking infinitely far into the atom.
Fissile material can be replicated with muons and antimuons hidden in
an atom. The setting is a infinite topopolis. The topopolis is
infinitely deep with mercury. The center has infinitely small object
that emits radiation like the sun. It is infinitely small. The
gravitational constant is 0. It would be satisfying to throw an
object at it because the object would explode as the radiation
intensity goes to infinity as it passes through.</font></font></p>

I don't think that light can be bent radially backwards by gravity.
When thing fall inside, it gains energy. There would never be when
the graviational potential cancels the energy because it is
exponential decay and not linear decay. It is just like you cannot
wait so that the radioactive substance decayed to a negative amount.
When pulling stuff from a deep gravity well, the cost is always less
than the total because before it was in the gravity well, it always
started with a positive amount of energy. That means that things
inside a black hole can always be pulled out. If it is true that
nothing can come out of the event horizon, then what determines the
event horizon would be gravitons. If they are pointed flat enough,
then they would define the inside of a supermassive blackhole which
has low surface gravity. That would mean that sometimes light would
just by change be redshifted into nothingness because nothing can
escape out of an event horizon.  In the theory that light can escape
an event horizon, light can be still bent backwards if the light
travel has a perpendicular component. To prevent light from escaping,
the black hole has to spin to catch all the light that travels
straight up. This explains why blackholes spin really fast. Blackhole
spin can be slowed down. Then, the blackhole would decay really fast.
It might split into 2 opposite spining black holes or multiple
blackholes which conserve angular momentum. If a blackhole gets
spined too fast, then it might also split into multiple blackholes.
The amount of impulse to crush a planet sized object into a blackhole
would likely be more than a supernova. The energy used might also get
in which cause the planet sized blackhole to become stellar mass. A
machine that makes a planet sized blackhole would likely have to be
bigger than the milky way. A better way to produce small black holes
would be to split existing blackholes into smaller blackholes.</font></font></p>

To create artificial sun for a topopolis in a zoo hypothesis
civilization. Reasons to assume that is that hawkin radiation was
never observed and that it is only significant in very small
blackholes. Only choice is orbital iron nickel cobalt (nickel series)
with magnetic field. Orbital meaning that it is stationary which
means no centrifugal force. The auroras would create the artificial
sunlight. Or, nuetrino (neutrino-neutrino or neutrino-anti-neutrino)
collisions. The nuetrinos would have to be very precise. A miniture
blackhole weighing about 10^16 tons would give out low hawking
radiation if it exist. The gravity from the blackhole can be used to
lens the neutrinos to make them collide more. The blackhole lens can
be used from the outside producing the nuetrinos or inside toward the
middle, but not near the crust of the topopolis because the gravity
field near the blackhole is still huge. If you don't want to use
nuetrinos, you can use light weight gas that fills the middle of the
topopolis. When the micro blackhole comes, the gas go towards it
causing accretion disk that looks like artificial sunlight. The
blackhole needs to spin really fast or is really small, so that it
doesn't accidentally eat the gas. Hydrogen gas can be pumped from
underneath the mercury bedrock to rise up. Ferromagnetic particles
could be put into the mercury which is then shoved upward really fast
by magnetic feild which then the particles are pulled up into space
to become part of the accretion disk. A volcano can be used to
disguise a input port to send the hydrogen gas straight into the
atmosphere. If muons are stable, muonium for lightness or muonic
hydrogen for small atomic radius can be used. Pion and kaon even if
nuetral charge cannot pass through to create an artificial sun
because they would get blocked. My first solution to lighting a
topopolis from outside was using pions because it had pi in the name
which pi is circle like the shape of a topopolis.</font></font></p>

Micro blackhole hawkin radiation as sun if is hawking-like blackhole
which could be moved by magnetic field. If fed by neutrino beam, then
the neutrino beam can be used to help push the blackhole while
feeding it. The blackhole needs to be carefully fed or else it would
spin slower which would cause the blackhole to violently decay.
Putting a blackhole into a topopolis can be through the crust. 2
blackholes from opposite sides or multiple which momentum add to 0
and rotational momentum add to what is wanted meet into the middle
really fast to minimize gravitational interaction with the crust.
Blackholes can be added at an end if the topopolis is not circular.
The topopolis is large which allows a large section to be a
inhospitable zone for machines to prevent the zoo hypothesis

The topopolis would be made of a strong material to contain the
things inside. Outside is a bunch of rocket engines or nukes which
would fire to counteract any nuke-sized explosion from the inside.
This prevents the hull from being destroyed. The stuff separating the
hull and inside would be a dense material. It would have a low
freezing point. The pressure that solidifies it would be in the 100s
of atmospheres. 10s of atmospheres if the zoo hypothesis is a small
scaled one. The solid would be be easily deformed, so that if there
was an explosion, it would quickly seal the crater. The solid would
need to conduct heat quickly, so that the zoo hypothesis civilization
cannot just melt their way through. A material that matches the
description would be a mercury alloy. The topopolis would have
materials that are not denser than the amalgam. Materials that are
denser than the amalgam would have a low critical mass so that making
a submarine out of it is infeasible. The fissile materials that are
denser than the amalgam need to be fissile enough so that any mixture
containing the fissile material must also have a very low critical
diameter or be less dense than the amalgam. The fissile material
cannot be transmutated into materials that are denser than the
amalgam and do not fit the description of the allowed fissile
material. Th-232 can be transmutated to u-238 which is denser than
mercury and non-fissile. Available fissile material inside the
topopolis is curium-247 which is less dense than hg-204. It can be
transmutated to californium which has even lower critical mass and
likely cannot form and compounds that have a high critical diameter
with higher density than hg-204. Submarines that might be able to
pass through the amalgam can be individually destroyed by a neutrino
beam. Some isotopes of hafnium are denser than some isotopes mercury.
Hafnium because its isotopes would separate in half if put in
mercury. Hafnium is the lightest nuclei that is denser than some
mercury. It is advisable to not give nuclei that can easily be
transmutated to hafnium. Mercury to polonium are safe to give to the
zoo because there is a bunch of short lived isotopes which prevents
transmutation to u-238.<br>
###### There are a lack of intermediate
black holes, but my blackhole theory can explain it. If stellar mass
black holes collide, they would have to be careful to not collide
into the opposite spin because that would cause neutral spin.
Therefore, intermediate blackholes are rare because when they form,
they have a large chance to be destroyed. The supermassive blackholes
don't have that problem because the mass is just too big. There are
also lots of stellar mass sized antimatter annihilation that were
detected and unexplained. That could be 2 opposite-spinning
intermediate mass blackholes which collided. The antimatter-matter
pair came from inside the blackhole.</font></font></p>

The best option would be neutrino beam. Neutrinos have a low rest
mass which means that the rest mass would not interfere with the
energy of collision. This means that the neutrino beam would be able

While spinning a blackhole slower to produce smaller blackholes, the
blackhole would leak light that barely could escape. The light would
fall back creating an invisible accretion disk. A solution would be
to use gamma ray reflective material to bounce the light in the
opposite direction to slow it down really fast. Another is to just
use a lot of ordinary matter at once which goes really fast into the
blackhole to slow the spin.</font></font></p>

topopolis for simulating ww2. This one can be made of maraging steel.
The tensile strength is 3.0 GPA. The density is 8.1 times water. 1000
pounds per cubic meter is about the density of lithium-6 which is the
lightest non-aerated solid element which is why pounds are better
than kg. The amalgam might be 13000 kg per cubic meter. Cube root of
amalgam density to earth density is about 1.332. It is cube root
because kinetic energy is also cube root to get penetration length.
The blast wave still has to be absorbed. Outside of the hull could be
be a bunch of bombs or rockets which would produce a blast wave in
the opposite direction to cancel the wave from inside. Extra mass
could be pushed onto the hull, but it cannot spin with the hull
because tangential velocity would cancel the gravity pull towards
hull. It can partially spin with the hull or a stationary. However,
it would have to be very frictionless. Maglev frictionless is likely
to not be possible because modern powered maglev can only exert
single digit megapascals of pressure which is very low compared to
what the pressure of amalgam exert. Another option is active support
like lightbox. Lightbox has the highest specific strength which is at
the fundamental limit. However, to make the light box would have to
be very good mirrors. Assume friction between the hull and stationary
mass is negligible. <strike>The stationary mass that is not touching
the hull would be made of pt-198. I thought platinum would be much
stronger than gold. However, they are about the same strength. Low
strength and hardness correlates to not cracking. Gold has the
highest toughness which is another reason to use gold instead of
platinum. Toughness is resistance to cracking. However, platinum is
significantly denser than gold which makes a good buffer so that the
blast wave could be delivered quicker. Thermonuclear bombs are
embedded into platinum.</strike> Actually, speed of sound have to be
take to account. Speed of sound times density is what determines the
best material which simplifies to sqaureroot of (stiffness times (not
divide) density) which makes osmium to be better than gold, tungsten,
platinum, and others. They would strategically detonate to cancel
whatever shape the blast wave from inside it. The crater that
hiroshima would have made if on ground would be 50 meters deep on
earth which would be 38 meters of mercury. The deepest bunker buster
in the world in current day only penetrates to 60 meters of concrete
which concrete is about 2 times less dense than earth. Since the
material displace is linear to depth, density is also linear
relationship. The bunker buster would only penetrate 12.7 meters of
the amalgam. At earth's gravity, a maraging steel hull 37526 meters
radius holding 1000 meters of mercury would be need to be 1572 meters
thick. Centripetal force dimish when going towards the center which
is not taken into account, so the number is an upper bound. The
elevation of 2572 meters would reduce the gravity to 93% which is
indistinguishable from earth gravity. Tsar bomba (50 megatonstnt) at
the surface would make a crater of 561 meters deep which would
quickly be filled in by the mercury flowing back in. So, even a
maraging steel topopolis is safe from ww2 zoo civilization.</font></font></p>

Cylinder thickness ratio is dependent on only strength and not
specific strength. Kevlar is only  slightly better than maraging
steel at 3.45 GPA. Tangential velocity is dependent on only specific
strength. Kevlar would be much better for a big cylinder because
kevlar has density of only 1.48 times water. The cold war arsenal of
70300 warheads is about 160 times tsar bomba which would make a
crater 3044 meters deep in the amalgam if extrapolating from
hiroshima. The chicxulub impact which was 10000 times the cold war
arsenal was 30 kilometers in the earth before rebounding which
extrapolating to cold war arsenal would make the cold war arsenal
only 485 meters deep. If 5000 meters of amalgam was used to tank a
hit from a cold war zoo civilization, the hull would 39612 meters of
kevlar not accounting for the diminishing centripetal acceleration
towards the center. The inner radius would be 74.7% of the outer
radius. The outer radius would be 176432 meters to produce 1g in the
inside and not need active support.</font></font></p>

Another reason why low critical mass is good is because it is less
deadly just like combustibles with low flash point can burn colder,
so it would prevent the combustible from piling up which piling up
would burn even hotter. The low critical mass prevents attempts to
collect lots of it because collecting a lot of it in a place would
cause explosion.</font></font></p>

gravity is proportional to aerial density. Escape velocity is
positively correlated to surface gravity and surface area. Therefore,
a planet made of less dense material would have higher escape
velocity compared to surface gravity. Escape velocity has no effect
on habitability. Surface gravity has negative effect on habitability.
So, lithium planet was a really good zoo</font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

There was once a fictional evil king named nidas because he named
himself after midas. Nidas was evil and liked gold. Then came a one

everywhere on the planet. The gravity was about 2.3 times higher than
earth which makes the escape velocity to be</font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">

PBS space time said that earth cannot handel 10^17 watts. However, it
can easily handle 10^17 watts by powering orbital rings to lift stuff

way to get to space from a lithium planet is to build a orbital ring

Disassemble the bottom one to build one above. Eventually, you would
step up to space. A better way is to build an orbital ring. Then,
heat the ring so that thermal expansion would increase the length
causing the ring to rise above to space.</font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">
</font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">This
method works better on lithium planets than normal planets because it
doesn't matter how big the planet is. The ratio between atmosphere
thickness and radius is proportional to how much the ring has to
expand. Wide planets have have wider mantel for the same thickness of
atmosphere. High gravity planets have thinner atmospheres. Therefore,
it is easier to escape out of a large planet.</font></font></p>

Even bigger topopolis could be made. It just have more stuff on the
outside pushing back on it. The outside things need to spin slower
than their (max tangential speed plus orbital speed) in order to push
down on the hull. The layers would would need to be low friction. The
layers progressively get slower as you go out, so that friction force
could be handled by being distributed between the layers instead of
one big friction force between 2 layers. Maglev would not work except
for the outermost layer because Maglev is only megapascals in
compressive strength. The big topopolis would be like the alonsphere
that I thought of when I was in 2024. Like the alonsphere, the
absolute difference of gravity pressure on the hull and the force
from inside is less than the tensile strength of the hull. In the
alonsphere, the force from inside is atmospheric pressure. In the
topopolis, the force from inside is the pressure at the bottom of the
bedrock.</font></font></p>

In early 2024, I reinvented alonsphere. I was thinking about a sphere
like space station that use sunlight to illuminate from outside. It
needs to be big because the space station is a setting for ww2 like

problem. Then, I realize that the gravity from inside would pull the
sphere inward helping it keep the atmosphere from pushing outwards.
If the shell was heavy, then the atmosphere would help prevent the
shell from collapsing which would allow kilometer thick shell. I also
thought how it would be made. I thought that the atmosphere could be
used to widen a malleable shell which I thought water and heat would
create high pressure, and the metal could come from an asteroid. So,
I reinvented water boiling in metallic asteroid to create a

The plutonium dart was named after the bloontonium dart. The
bloontonium dart use a thing called crystal annihilation array which
name was derived from crystal fusion array. It lines up matter
antimatter pairs to annihilate to shoot in the right direction. The
front of the crystal annhilation array is a cylinder of plasma made
of depleted plutonium which is plutonium-244 which is the heaviest
long lived isotope and the longest lived isotope of plutonium like
depleted uranium. Curium and other fissile isotopes should be safe to
use because plasma density would be so small, that when critical mass
is recalculated to account for density, the critical mass would have
already diverged to infinity far before. However, iron-56 might be
the best choice. Binding energy per nucleon is irrelevent because the
photon energy is so large it would interact with the rest mass of
nucleon which neutron is less stable. The gamma rays would hit the
plutonium plasma and get absorbed. The plasma is hot and irradiate.
There could be mirrors which direct the light backwards to increase
efficiency but lower emissivity. The cylinder has only a radiation
lengths if it want to be fast. That would make the gamma rays still
very dangerous at the front. The gamma rays are like ray of doom.
There is hydrogen, antihydrogen, and cargo around the cylinder.
Antihydrogen would have to be near the crystal annhilation array
because transport of antihydrogen is hard. When I came up with the
idea do of plutonium dart as a relativistic travel, 7.22 day 2024 was
near. Numberphile pi day special video had a word pion-neer in the
title. It was a coincidence because I had recently researched about
hydronic antimatter reactions which would create pions. A optional
tunnel to accelerate the plutonium dart would be called a dartling
gun. The thickness of the milky way disk is about 3000 light years
which coincides with 3000 tiles in bloons monkey city. Only bloons
monkey city have specialty buildings named crystal fusion array.
Interstellar gas would damage the plutonium darts just like the
"darts can't reach that far" message when you try to
capture a tile far away. Outside of the disk doesn't have the
interstellar gas problem which is why the "darts can't reach
that far" is only for the 3000 tiles. Bloontonium dart is
related to the dartling gun because it is the only useless upgrade in
the bloonsverse. Powerful darts is not useless because theoretically
if pierce times rate of fire is used as dps, then powerful darts
would increase the damage.  The only tower that use antimatter in the
bloonsverse is tech terror which is the 3rd most powerful tower right
before ray of doom. In january, I was researching nuclear powered ion
drive because I thought about a space trip to titan, titania, and
triton around the time of saturn uranus sun collinear. I was
listening to watashitachi wa mirai no hana over and over again
because I like the song and wanted that it was nanjolno who sing it
and not mimori. I had known that umi sonoda color coincides with
neptune color. I imagined the nuclear reactor would glow red to
radiate the heat which looks like red flowers which is mentioned in
the song. A few days after 7.22.2024 I thought the nuclear reactor
would look like the energy beacon which I read the specialty building
discription in monkey city which mentioned the word "nexus".
A day later there was video about a new diepio update that had the
word "nexus". I thought about the fact that no one would
bring an asteroid down to earth, so no one would bring the helium-3
in gas giant up from there. So, I thought to sink the nuclear
reactors into the gas giant. I choose uranus because the name is like
a joke. On 7.22.2024, I thought what a hot uranus and neptune would
be like. I remembered that minecraft world is about the size of
neptune, so I thought hot neptune would a minecraft world filled with
blocks of lava 256 by 30 million by 30 million. It was a time before
I ever watched issac arthur. Now, I don't think we would make hot
uranuses because there is nicole dyson beam to mine jupiters. But,
hot uranuses might be a thing if there was not sun.</font></font></p>

Widening the inner radius does not prevent it from turning into a
black hole because both perimeter and schwarchild radius increase
linearly. The schwarchild radius of mercury is 0.722441 astronomical
unit which is less than the required thickness to stop a supernova.
There is also a width limitation to the aloncylinder which it cannot
have a tangent velocity greater than speed of light which corresponds
to 0.962584450007741 lightyears in radius for a 1g gravity. Gravity
outside of the hull is the same as gravity in a infinite plane. A 2g

big tube. For 1g centripetal acceleration and hg-204, the thickness

theia-class impact. If the inner radius is small, it can be made
thicker. Unlike outward presssure, inward pressure is hard to correct
and probably impossible because stuff like magnetism is weak and
would disturb other stuff. Centripetal pressure is
\frac{\left(a+x\right)c}{a} times density. Gravitational pressure is
2\pi\cdot g\cdot b\cdot x times density. Gravitational pressure is
inward and centripetal pressure is outward which they cancel. The net
pressure is
\left(\int_{0}^{x}\left(b\left(\frac{\left(a+y\right)c}{a}-\
2\pi\cdot g\cdot b\cdot y\right)\right)dy\right). An inner radius of
about 2060000 meters would allow a hg-204 hull with a thickness of
20000 meters. A hull stabilized by gravity would allow the
non-spinning hull to not need to push down on it. It also means that
the zookeepers only need dumb hydrogen bombs to counter the explosion
from inside. It is unlike layered hull which too much explosion from
the outside would damage components. If there was no gravity and the
height of the hull was 1 second and the hull can handel 208.4 tpa and
the hull density is 10 times water because under high pressure, then
at earth's gravity, the hull can handel 2111533467.10632 meters per
second of tangential velocity which is higher than the speed of
light. Because gravity, topopolis would not need super strong
material. That means banks orbital can be built with any material
that is dense enough to be like earth or weak dumb matter. To have
the same apparent brightness as the sun, a dim quasar would have to
be about 12 light years away which would correspond to a bank's
orbital with about 0.1g and a tangential velocity near the speed of
light. To have the same brightness of sun at a light year away would
be about 4 billion suns of luminosity which is about ultraluminous
AGN. It doesn't seem that isaac arthur knows that bank's orbital
could be made without strong materials, science fantasy, active
support, or stuff. I search on google, everyone is saying that banks'
orbital needs strong stuff. Even if gravity doesn't exist, it would
still be easy to make banks' orbital using atompunk aloncylinder

low technology thing. This makes the people trust the religion. The
religion prophecy about "People in the end times will be evil.
They would believe in cold liquid crystal. They like the cold because
the cold is the heart of the devil. Cold is like when there is no
sun. Cold is like the deep mercury bedrock. The false prophets will
use white cold gas to hide his trickery. People will practice
necromacy and mind reading. They will claim to have revived the
prophets who died many ages ago. The false prophets will spew
blasphemy against what the real prophet have said. The false prophets
will contradict what the real prophet have said while claiming to be
the original. They will believe in false gods and other suns. They
say that their gods live in under the cold mercury. They will say
that under the mercury is a heaven. When Christ return, all the false
prophets and non-believers will be thrown far under the cold mercury
to be buried and crushed. Their bodies will be crushed smaller than a
grain of sand. There will be no heaven under the cold mercury. They
will live eternity in a formless death. The cold mercury is infinite
which nothing that exits earth and heaven can escape it. The gates to
death are wide open, but the gate to the real heaven is smaller than
the eye of a needle." The symbol of mercury is the symbol of the
messenger god. Another religion believes the opposite. The religion
is controlled opposition. It is named as greek religion. The greeks
believed in pseudoscience and practice spiritual crystals,
meditation, speaking in tongues, rituals, and stuffs.  The greek
religion believed "The flood story is true which involved a huge
flood of mercury and a rainbow at the end. The rainbow is a message
from god, so they named a goddess after it. The cold mercury was the
mediator between the living and the dead. Far below the mercury is
the realm of the dead where secret messages are created and travel
across the cold mercury. The god of mercury was a translator and can
translate between languages and between secret energies. If you
decipher the secret energies for long enough, you will gain knowledge
that no other method could provide." The greeks spoke many
different languages, and their religion predicted many wrong things.
The people will have to choose between the 2 religions and decide
whether it is better to be right at first or right at last. </font></font>

pressure inside each gap to the outside pressure? " was prompted

balence small number of keys and matching to major third and major
fifth. 128 cones because power of 2 so easy to encode. With equal
temperment, that would make the lowest peak at 288.53nm. If use piano
as vision it would be ratio 161 2^(88/12). If use just ratios, it
would be piano fifths are 163.5 (1.5)^(88/7) piano forths are 158.09
(4/3)^(88/5). Assume that sample window reach +-1 in semitone around
peak. uvb is range between piano and piano-17 which is
53306/2^(89/12) 311.987nm and 53306/2^(129/17) 277.006 . The 2
numbers are very round which is a coincidence to use them so uvb
277-312nm. Dinitrogen bond strength is 127nm in planck's law and it
is significant because that means that the light get a peak in

song for u u u, eli ayase make all the outfits. A reason why nanjolno
would make all of them is if they are transparent to ir or uv, then
it would create multispectral nudes.<br>

###### Umi in umi sonoda name means sea and future.
Future as in future style. One of umi solo is anemone heart which

###### Communism means russian. USA abbreviation in
russian is <span lang="ru-RU">сша </span><span lang="en-US">which
is c</span>wa. So that means that communist usa is cwa. It stands for

almost 42069. So, nanjolno should be born in old zip code 42069. Yen
is Y. Zip code is T. Yt as in nanjolno intials if nanjolno married

While writing about writing about it, I thought about </font></font><font face="Liberation Serif, serif"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt">"
</font></font><em>The Fault in Our Stars</em> by John Green "
because it includes a fictional fiction book. The title even mention
stars like the stars that are outside of the topopolis. Therefore,
anyone who is reading this should write a book. Imagine if a bunch of
authors were greedy like the hypothetical people who trademarked the
words "zima", "zero", "voicekit",
"lovelive", "re:", "boku", "kimi",
"wa", "shojou", "no", "anata",
"ga", "suki", "dai", "tokubetsu",
"oonaji", "kono", "te", "wo",
"iru", "stasi", "B STUDIO", "ebook",
"lyft", "lyfe", "watre", "we",
"i", "iphone", "nitro" and other stuff.
If they were greedy, they would certainly write a book titled "<i>An

###### bcx+\left(\frac{bc}{2a}-\pi gb^{2}\right)x^{2} is the formula
for net pressure of a banks' orbital. \frac{bc}{2a}-\pi gb^{2} is a

adding more mass. So for small diameter topopolis, use aloncylinder
design because slowing down spin rate for outer layers would be
required for a net downward pull.

the lowest element number (other than O,H,C,Xe) would be Si. 2 noble

The civilization realize they are not living near heaven but in a
prison like the enderdragon in 18th beta update realize that they are
not living in the sky but in the void. Red is the penetrating

###### A emnb made of pure mercury would be weaker against

pressure is inward. A solution is that it is made of hard stuff on
the part that is net pressure inward. The stuff would have to be as
dense as mercury or else damage to it would cause stress because of
difference in displacement. The only element that has isotopes with
densities inbetween the densities of mercury is hafnium.

###### Nested topopolis containment. Mercury-hafnium then hafnium

all elements. That means that hafnium is even better than tungsten.
Melting point is irrelevant because many materials start to dissolve
in other metals far below their melting point and do other stuff that
fluids do. The outer shell is spinning retrograde to prevent stuff
from below to easily get through to the other side. If it is red hot
then it would be hard to cool something down from the outisde. One
way of lowering the temperature, is by using black holes. Mercury and
hafniumare hg and hf g and f like GF, and H stands for hot. So, hot
gf. Black holes because that sounds sexy. Black holes can be orbiting

won't do shit", and call the others who did do stuff as psyop
and controlled opposition. The japanese fans think they are like
rina-chan who would do really cool stuff, but they actually would
just fail at it. It reminds me of fail vtubers and other japanese
stuff. They make a whole bunch of high resolution low effort media
that just fills space in whatever sever the stuff is on. I am like
setsuna yuki because the idea [that when others try but improve so
little means that nothings happening] is such a doomer mindset.
Setsuna yuki destroyed the idol group before she became 3rd year

already knew were not as memorable. So, I thought about "miji"
when thinking about the song. I usually don't enjoy symphogear songs
other than nanjolno solos. The duos are overdone compared to nanjolno
solos. The green girl lyrics sounds to be off. It was because I
trained myself to believe that nanjolno solos are the best.</p>

###### I am a feynman bro but computer science. Feynman bros are bad
at physics like I am bad at computer science. A reason to be a
feynman bro is that feynman was born on 1918 and died on 1988 which
18 and 88 are hitler numbers. Feynman birthday is 5.11 which
5.11.1994 is the arithmetic mean between me and nanjolno birthday
which is copalindrome with 11.5.2023 which is the day that is next in
arithmetic series of me and nanjolno birthday. I am a jolnobro, so
when nanjolno went to south korea, I was like "jolnobros... not

milky holmes season 2 episode 1 when I was in march of 2nd semister
of 11th grade. I decided that it was a secret message that told me to
apply to harvard and do international relations. It was because the
episode showed farmers to be really cringey. Harvard because kokoro
akechi. International relations because the word showed up in milky
holmes in season 1. I applied to harvard and harvard only. I wrote
all my essays about minecraft. I didn't get it. I was pre-approved to
public college which I was pressured by parents to chose computer
science. It was in 2021 when computer science was already declining

hosted olympics and not a capital city in japan. Emi nitta name has
similar etymology as umi sonoda which mimorin married a muscley dude.
He was born in 1987. Pile and mimorin both had seperate dating rumour
before 2019 which is a coincidence that they are both from tokyo.
Nozoeli because va first name are aino and aina which is same word
but different gender in spanish grammar. Aina kusuda is chiba
prefecture born. Chiba is crescent-like shape with tokyo being where
star is and pile is born in tokyo. It is anatomically similar to
korea and japan. Disclimer is that cresent and star was not a muslim
symbol until 1500s. Before, christians and pagans used the symbol.
Chiba is also where soramaru was from so soramaru and kussun married
and that better be true. Rippi from saitama which is named after a
legendary figure. Kiev is also named from legendary figure. So, rippi
marriage predicted russia ukraine war. Shikaco is from nara
prefecture which is where shinzo abe was assasinated. Shikaco is
connected to hitler (because I written before), and shinzo abe is far
right. Aya uchida is born in outa which sounds similar to oto. Oto is
a name of a song from nanjolno solo music career. The begining of it
sounds like the background music in clockwork planet. That means that
nanjolno knows that aya uchida is connected to informatics. Nanjolno
is born in shizouka prefecture because maybe she was born at home

Chromosome 15 encodes hair color and eye color which are about

######
Germany should split back in 2. West germany capital berlin. DDR
capital is kaliningrad. Unique holidays are: july 4th city day, may 2
victory in berlin. may 9 victory day. May 2 and may 9 because they
are a week apart. No liberation day or unification day recognized.
State police should not named stasi because that would be like naming
based of something in fiction. Chancellor should be the head of state
office because nostalgia, and nanjolno can be chancellor of ddr and
empress of japan at the same time. Germany and japan are axis power,
and empress and chancellor title at the same time because they are
the same chess pieces in fairy chess. Succession order after
chancellor should be: minister of ministry then employees in ministry
of ministry. Ministry of ministry is a ministry that handels
succession. Other name for ddr: deutsch federation which alpha-2 is
df like dd, de, and df are consecutive. 3 letter code: dfa. A because
it is 1st letter in alphabet so it is a placeholder. It should be df
because it needs to one up the real germany. Dfa is the most famous
thing in btdb which bmc is the next most famous. Bmc can also stand
for bloons monkey city which does not have cobra. Bmc is not a 3166
alpha 3 code yet. Dfa because it is copalindrome with afd which is
the dominate party in east germany. Dialing country code of east
germany and japan is 37 and 81 which is almost 36 and 84 which
multiplies to 3024 which llsif card #3024 related to chess. 84 dial
code vietnam. Hungary dial code is 36. 36*84 is 3024. Vietnam because
viet is a substring of soviet which soviet union is known for being
the best at chess. Hungary because judit polgar and iso3166alpha3 is
HUN which ends in UN like SUN. Judit polgar initals are JP like
japan. Japan dial country code is 81 which is copalindrome of 18.
Flipping the symbol of christianity means to be anti-christian. So,
81 means to not support age of consent which japan is known for
lolicons.<br>
###### Victory in berlin is abreviated to vb which are
22nd and 2nd letters of alphabet like two's day. Victory in europe is
abreviated to ve which are 22nd and 5th letters of alphabet which

###### Parenthenogenesis in humans would need genetic imprinting.
Both Yp and Yq would have genes that can do genetic imprinting.
Parenthenogenesis is done by female. Yq being a telocentric
chromosome would be called Q. So, XQ might be able to do
parenthenogenesis, but they would have to have fertility that other
people who were detected as swyer and turner syndrome don't have. The
mature egg cell is created with either X or Q chromosome. The primary
polar body does not divide, but sticks next to the mature egg cell.
If the sperm cell hits either one, then pregnancy would happen
normally. But, if the zygote is QY then it is non-viable or becomes a
tumor or a tumor that is part of a chimera. My parents first name
start with Q and Y. It is like I am also non-viable. Genetic
imprinting is determined by germline and the genes that do it are
autosomal. It would still have to be swyer syndrome because y genes
activate genes that does imprinting. That also means that XQ zygote
created from sperm would be non-viable because both would be male
imprinting. The polar body would need to be opposite imprinting of
the egg cell. Instead of apoptosis, the polar body or egg cell would
have to fertilize the other. The second polar body would either die
or become a chimera with the zygote which being chimera might be more
likely because the primary polar body would also have stick with the
zygote which might mean that the second polar body also stick. X is
elon's favorite letter. Q is trump favorite letter. XQ is like a
trump and elon bromance.

###### A way that boipussy and girlpussy can exist. A gonad follows
fox genes and estrogen which causes it to be placed inside the colon.
The other gonad develop like usual. If girl, then one uterus would
open into the colon and the other open in vagina. If boy, then a
uterus open into colon and the other becomes balls and stick.
Interaction with fox genes would be required because one have to do
it but not both, so it could be called a foxhole. To get 2 balls from
1 gonad would need polyorchidism. Or, start with 3 gonads. One which
only has male duct develop into testes if there is testosterome else
it become undiffrentiated. One which only has female fuct would be
developed into an ovary that connects to the anus. One would be a

###### Mary sueism is a religion invented by mary sue's biggest fan.
Hypothetically, there was once a mary sue. The mary sue wants to
marry a man. She has to choose a man. She decides to plant secret
clues about her. The clues is so that a man would find out and marry
her. The clues subtle so that it takes a smart man to find them.
However, it is not about intelligence but rather being at the right
place at the right time thinking the right thing. A conspiracy
theorist that just connect random dots from /pol/ 4chan does many
tries a time while an actual smart person wastes his time on
theoretical math problems (that does not have a physical application)
that someone else smarter than him already solved (for example:
school). So, a random neo-nazi 4channer discover that some
connections were quite strong than what he usually sees. He digs
deeper and discover the mary sue. Although the 4channer is very
misogynistic, it is the modern type of misogyny which acknowledges
that some women are very smart and competent but believes that women
should be controlled by men because women have bad political
opinions. The mary sue is not aware of him because many different
possible reasons. The 4channer worship the mary sue like how the
nazis worshiped nietzche. Just like the nazis liked nietzche but
ignored the parts where nietzche defended jews, he discard the mary
sue's blog posts that contains opinions while being infatuated with
mary sue's appearance and intelligence. The 4channer creates a
religion and manifesto worshiping the mary sue. The 4channer's
beliefs and writtings were filled with hate. The 4channer names his
new religion based on mary sue as the ultimate act of worship. The
contest for mary sue to choose her husband was like the contest to
choose the participants in the willy wonka chocolate factory. It was
an example of maximizing a metric gone wrong. The fat kid won, and
that 4channer is likely also a fat kid. The 4channer knows all of
this and is self-aware like the chess scene in sherlock holmes is
unrealistic because people can think ahead.</p>

ukraine and ddr. Nanjolno was named after east germany, and nanjolno
supports ukraine.<br>
###### 49 dialing code is west germany. West
germany is the most fake economy, so the 49th president would be dei
like sakura ayane.<br>
###### 50 is falkland islands. Argentina
claims it. Which 2 letter code is ar like how element 18 was
connected to sumire uesaka.<br>
###### 51 dialing code is peru which
mean that the president would be so unpopular that us collapse.</p>
