Each leap year is skipped every 128 years not 100 years:

There reason to skip it on 2048 which is what the comment section says with the the reason that 2048 is a power of 2 like 128 being the interval to skip a year and 4 being the interval to leap a year. Other reasons are: One reason is that Nanjolno is born on '84 and it would be skipped on '48 which are paliendroms. Nanjolno's birthday would be 64 (like a stack in minecraft and a power of 2). Also in juche it would be 73 and 137. which 137 is universal constant and contains 37. they are important because of the sources. Another reason for 137 juche is that 73 (Nanjolno birth year) is 21st prime, 37 (year of centuray) is 12th prime. adding 21 and 12 gives 33. and 33rd prime is 137.

There are reasons to skip it on 2040. The juche year would be 129 which would be 1 plus a power of 2. Also if you concatenate my age and nanjolno age this year (2024, which ends in 24, and 24*2 is 48 as in 2048, which is a reason that counters this), you can get 2040. Nanjolno would be 56 which is a famous last birthday celebrated on april 20, 1945. 





python

>for i in range(1,10):

>→    for j in range(1,10):

> →   →    print(i,j,100+10*i+j-10*j-i)

>exit()


There are 6 outputs that matches 64

Corresponds to the pair of years: 1940 2004, 1951 2015, 1962 2002, 1973 2037, 1984 2048, 1995 2059

And in juche converted to AD would be: 1951 2015, 1962 2002, 1973 2037, 1984 2048, 1995 2059, 2006 2070

So the other candidate would be thoose.

My birthday only comes up once. Nanjolno birthday comes up 2 times.
