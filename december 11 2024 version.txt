## incompatible

In the begining there was a neutron star in the universe which is the surface of a hypersphere. The beams were bent by the hypersphere to create a fake sun and moon back on the surface of the neutron star. The beams were diffrent because of wave interferance with each other. The moon light is mostly made of high frequency light, so it is able to penetrate and give everything properties within 256 blocks of ordinary matter. The sunlight is mostly made of infrared, visible and ultraviolet light, which is much less penetrating. However, the magnetic field from the neutron star blocking the radiation is still so strong that almost nothing can detect the day and night cycle. 

The universe starts to expand while being steady state for the neutron star. This made the neutron star bigger really fast. The neutron star collapse creating a singularity in the middle. It left 2 outer shells of nuetronium behind. The 2 shells interacted with modified gravity to stay the gravitationally stable. Since modified gravity does not follow newton's shell theorum, the inner shell split into a lower shell and a middle shell due to diffrent gravitation interation with the upper shell. The lower and middle shell was the nether and the upper shell was the overworld. The nether was filled with holes because of the gravitational reaction while the overworld had no holes. The universe is still expanding which alters the wave interference between the sunlight and moonlight causing the moon cycle.  The magnetic field is still blocking most of the light because of light lag. The magnetic field gives out its own radiation which is like sunlight but harmless.

Because everything else did not expand with accordance to its own energy density, the nuetron star became the largest object in the universe pulling everything including intelligent life from far away towards it. Any matter that wish to survive without falling into the singularity would have to be able to teleport on to the surface of the 3 shells of neutronium. The first creatures to inhabit the minecraft world were endermen. It was because they were able to survive the fall down from the event horizon to the overworld by teleportation. All other items that fell through were going so fast, that their radiation length were really long. This means that they reacted very little when they fall through. The light that beams down from the sky were so blue shifted that they produced matter pairs which could interact with the world's magnetic field.




After landing on the overworld, the endermen used nether reactor core to teleport to the nether. The nether had almost nothing but some pieces of nuetronium. Some endermen drop down the nether with neutronium to place it randomly. A few pieces were placed in the correct spot to form the main end island. There was a place (different from the main end island) in the internether void where endermen could teleport over and over again to the same spot making it seem that they have anti-gravity. The endermen use teleportation to pull matter from the singularity. Because of the no hair theorem, the matter is always the same being endstone. The endermen and the endstone made up the outer end islands. Outer was only in perspective of the main end islands only after the main end island connects to it. There were no radial gaps in the outer end islands and there were no center.


Void is a pun. All portals teleport to the singularity. They just differ in the where it is teleported out of the singularity. Since the output is the same place as input then it is void because default answer is the same place. This also makes end island also a void portal since the definition of default changed from the place of transportation to the place of the original portal. The default place could also mean staying in the singularity which means that the object is destroyed. The void portals lit by bedrock and lava would produce a portal that does just that.

Because the speed of light is finite, the nuetron star's magnetic feild was still strong. It blocks the matter pairs that were produced from light. The magnetic feild was so strong that it produced an aurora that outshines all the light in the sky. Therefore, the sky looks like it was always sunny. Since the magnetic field blocks the particles, none of the particles would affect like the day and night cycle.

As the time passed, the nuetronium decayed into bedrock. The bedrock decayed into stone in the overworld and netherrack in the end. The endermen made glassware from the stone. Endermen were able to use glassware to observe the stars through the blinding aurora. The most important discovery that the endermen made were about noble gases. Like in real life, the process were all the same except for helium because there are no petroleum reserves in minecraft. 

The starlight that was observed by endermen was still the same light that was close to the nuetron star right before the steady state expansion. The minecraft crust used antigravity to prevent the starlight that was close to neutron star surface from blueshifting. But the antigravity only fully reverses the light's blueshift, if it originated close to the surface.

Helium that was observed by the endermen has an average mass of 3 in minecraft. Helium was never observed on the ground or in the atmosphere, but it was only observed in the stars. The sky was always bright. (helium in english means "sun") The endermen think of bright things as closer to holy than the dark things, so the endermen thought the stars were holy. Some endermen think the stars are angels hanging around above the transparent firmament. 

Neon in minecraft has an average mass of 21. It was first discovered in the atmosphere. (neon in english means "new") After it was already named, the endermen discovered it in supernova and in the stars before they went supernova. Since the endermen forgot why neon was named neon, the endermen thought neon means that it was a new star forming instead of a star dying. Because the neutron star remnent is more positive in absolute brightness, it was actually a star disappearing from the endermen's view.


Argon has an average mass of 36 in the minecraftverse, but it has an average mass of 40 in minecraft. Argon was also discovered in supernova, but not as much. It wasn't named yet. The argon in supernova remnant was discovered to weigh 36, but on minecraft, it weighed 40. The endermen thought it was just 2 different elements. The endermen decided that the reason for the similarity in emission spectrum was because the elements were so inert that it was hard to tell the difference using chemical reactions, so it was named as inert. (argon in english means "inert") Many endermen believed that the existence of 2 different inert elements is a god given analogy which shows that even the most righteous, pure, clean, holy, .... earthly thing is no match for the righteous, pure, clean, holy, .... thing in heaven. The worldly argon weighs 40 which is not as interesting as the number 36. "Jesus fasted for 40 days, but in heaven, he would have fasted for 3 consecutive periods of 12 days" the endermen reasoned.

Krypton and strontium both have an average mass of 84 in minecraft. Krypton was also discovered in supernova, but was not discovered before the star went supernova. The endermen named it as if it was hidden inside the star before it went supernova, so they named it as krypton. (krypton in english means "hidden")

Strontium weighed the same as krypton, but was not discovered in the sky because low mass stars are too dim to see with telescope. The endermen thought strontium was a different type of krypton. The spectrum was different, but the endermen reasoned it was just different allotrophes. So, the endermen called strontium as kryptonite. (kryptonite in english means "something that makes superman weak") The ending part of the word to reference that the type of krypton was solid. The endermen observed that when they eat kryptonite, their brains work slower and they became weaker. Kryptonite replaces calcium in neurons and muscle fibers. Since kryptonite has a higher molecular mass than calcium, it moves slower which slows the recharge rate of neurons and muscle fibers.

Lithium weighed 7 in minecraft. Like kryptonite, the endermen could only find it on earth. Unlike kryptonite, the endermen believed that lithium was a completely new element. Many endermen liked lithium because it calms them down and that 7 is a holy number. Endermen believes the calming experience is the effect of connecting to a higher reality.

Carbon had an average weight of 12 which had the same color as endermen's skin. Endermen really liked their skin color because 12 is a holy number

Xenon had an average weight of 127. Xenon was only discovered in supernova that came from neutron stars which the endermen called "blinking stars". The endermen thought the blinking stars are strange. And that out of all the elements found on minecraft, only xenon was discovered to be nowhere other than from blinking stars which was also strange. So, it was named as strange. (xenon in english means "strange") Although xenon was never isolated in minecraft due to endermen's technological limitation, the endermen believed that they still have xenon. It was actually iodine. The spectrum were a little different but it was still purple. Endermen dismiss the inconsistency thinking that xenon was just a strange element.

Iron was already named, but the endermen did not know why it was named that. (iron in english means "holy") When the endermen discovered the supernova, they found so much nickel which was an element that is never discovered on minecraft. The nickel had a half-life of 6 days which deacys to cobalt that had 77 days of half-life until it turns into iron. (both nickel and cobalt in english means "devil") The endermen concludes that since iron is holy, then nickel and cobalt also relates. They were 3 elements which made the endermen think that it is like the trinity as in the 3 crosses. So the endermen named the 2 other metals as nickel and cobalt because the 2 others on the cross were not jesus. Another reason why the endermen thought they were related to jesus was that on average, nickel decayed on the 7th day, and then stay as cobalt for 11 periods of 7 days, and then finally turn into iron. In total, there were 12 periods of 7 days. 1 as nickel which represent the criminal on the cross that criticized jesus. the endermen compared him to judas just like there were 1 judas and 11 other diciples. Because judas sold jesus for money, nickel's symbol was the smile instead of the star. (nickel sounds like nico yazawa which has the symbol of a smile) The smile represents the obverse on the coin. Stable nickel from the alpha process was observed to be mass of 60. The endermen could not observe the zinc's decay chain because the half-life was so small. The endermen concluded that 60 represents the number of smiles on 30 shekels of silver. Each shekel had a smile on each side. 

Endermen considered there to be 7 sacred elements. The first is iron which is due to its own name. The next 3 are helium, lithium, and carbon because they correspond to 3, 7, and 12. The endermen believed that the 3 numbers are the most holy of all numbers because endermen are christians. The next 3 are neon, argon, and krypton because they correspond to products of 3, 7, and 12 which are 21, 36, and 84.

As endermen practiced their new belifes, the endermen stopped leaving skeletons when they died. This is because that kryptonite replaces the calcium in their bones. Kryptonite is a bigger ion which makes it more water soluble which causes the skeleton to decay too quickly. Endermen stored their dead in the nether because nether was spacious without many important stuff. The kryptonite (which leaked out of decaying endermen skeletons) combined with aluminum oxide and europium to make glowstone which makes clumps of glowstone everywhere in the nether. (glowstone glows green in real life like kryptonite in superman movies) Europium doesn't glow by itself, so the endermen who believed in god but not jesus were named after them. (еврейский and европий are similar in pronounciation)

Endermen had all the same color eyes which were greenish blue, but they differ in color when their eyes blinked. The endermen debated what color the eye blinks should be. Some endermen believed that it should be red because the emission spectrum of lithium is red, and 7 and 12 are numbers that are alike which 7 corresponds to lithium and 12 corresponds to carbon. However some endermen believe that a blink is best expressed with xenon because xenon is the element from the blinking star. Another reason to choose xenon was that it had both 7 and 12 as digits of the atomic mass. Xenon was more convincing that lithium, so the endermen use eugenics to make their eye blinks to be purple color. Iodine which the endermen called 'worldly xenon' was a bit pinkish. Xenon was a bit bluish. The endermen choose the average which was a deep purple. Since the endermen picked iodine as the color of their blinks, endermen gave iodine the symbol of an eye. (in english, the letter 'I' that is used as the symbol for iodine is pronounced the same as eye) In order to enforce the eugenics program, when an endermen look at another endermen, they had to blink. Blinking shows that the endermen has purple blinks. If the endermen or thing that looks like an endermen (this includes the player) does not blink purple, the endermen would get made and attack.






## 0.0.1.14
First version which is compatible with my minecraft theory because 0.0.1.14 and 0.0.1.15 are very similar. Some of the stone are iron ore, coal ore, or gold ore. The stone decayed into gravel and then to sand which then decayed into dirt and grass blocks. Trees grew on the grass blocks. The endermen lived in Rainforest, Seasonal forest, Ice desert, and Shrubland, so the player never sees them.

The news of the massive wither attack got to the outer end islands. The endermen decided to team up and build things to fight

Beetroot is a plant native to the end. In fact, the only foodstuff that can be found in end city chests are beetroot. Beetroot was created to teach the later generations about what nether wart looks like. End city ships have a brewing stand without any potion ingredients. It means that the residence, long ago, use to have potion materials, but potion ingredients cannot grow in the end that time.

The end ship have never flew. When the endermen tried to build a flying thing, they found that obsidian did not fall because of it's immovability ability. "Since it didn't fall, then it is closer to flying" they thought. However, the obsidian prevented the ship from flying because of the same property. They put a dragon head (which didn't ever come from a dragon) on it to try to make it fly. Elytra in a item frame was also there.

Endermen heard news about a new heaven between the nether and the overworld after the withers ascend through the top of the nether roof. They heard that the new heaven dropped nether stars which could be made into beacons. The endermen think that beacons may be the way to make the flying machine. The endermen built a place for the beacon on the ship but never finished it because the nether stars never dropped.

Endermen say that the eon of nether star rain was not happening. So the endermen tried to do it artificially.  The endermen created the shulker. It had levitation so that the endermen hoped that they can send troops and fight off floating withers which are believed to float up and cause destruction. The levitation technology only got as good as shulker. Another thing that the endermen believed is that if they levitate a ender pearl enough, they can make the soul in the pearl go to heaven. Believing that the problem was in the sky, the endermen invented the starfighter. It was suppose to roam up in the sky and fight the fictional withers which prevent the nether stars from raining. However, according to the vietnam war, the starfighter evolved to be the phantom. But the outer end islands were still uncontacted from the rest of the minecraft world which prevents the phantom from attacking steve. The dead starfighters were used to make elytras.

As tauons getting more and more common in the end dimension. Tauons protect against red matter which means more antimatter annihilation. The radiation is sensed by the enderdragon. But like a bull, the enderdragon cannot see the color red. Dragons are lizards so enderdragon has heat sensors. The sensors activate from the penetrating radiation. Because red is close to infrared, the enderdragon sense them as red.  The enderdragon saw the void redden. The enderdragon concludes that it is not the sky dimension at all because the sky is blue thought the dragon.  

The reason why gardians have orange hair is because they see themselves as the protagonists like honoka in M's.

## 1.18

The enderdragon saw that the red light keeps getting redder until it is like night. Anticipating something bad to happen the enderdragon decided to replace its grave at 0,0. The placement is special since it lights a portal in such a way that it creates invisible portal that connects the main end island to the rest of the end islands. However there is are radial gaps thousands of blocks wide because the portal disrupts other portals that once connects all the outer islands together. Night also means moon, so the enderdragon gets more attacks and invulerabilities.

Although, some have very weak coincidences with their corresponding number, I need to put it out there in case other people put out their theories. To test how strong the coincidences, see if there are other coincidences with other discographies or in a different ordering.  So I decided to connect each minecraft version to its corresponding fripside album or mv. The ordering is based on the numbering in 2020.04.01 - fripSide infinite video clips 2009-2020 and the new albums get number one by one

2nd music video is level5 judgelight. In a different text file, I have wrote about that 2 connects to level5 because 2-ary logic can do anything that 5-ary logic can. However 5-ary logic is confusing because there are lots of different gates that takes 2 input and return one output and is not easily converted back into 2-ary logic since 5 is coprime to 2. The version is the 1st version to have code obfuscation which is like programming in 5-ary logic.

0.0.1.3
In the 3rd music video, nanjolno was in a cave. This version of minecraft adds cave generation. also the title of the music video is future gazer which  means to gaze into the future. So this version gazes into the future and skip a couple of numbers

0.0.1.9
9th music video is eternal reality. The title has reality which means that you can't really gaze over it because you wouldn't be able to survive. It is eternal which means long time that contains the future. It is more realistic because added build mode.

0.0.1.10
10th music video is black bullet. The minecraft version is unplayable which is like getting a black bullet. There is also a time in music video where the time pauses like how this version added game pause. Clockwork planet mv doesn't count as a pause because it is actually time reverse.

0.0.1.11
11th music video is infinite synthesis. The music is named the same as the albums of phase 2. It is analogous to naming a minecraft version as minecraft. 0.0.1.11 is named as minecraft because the version is used to mark anniversaries and is the first public version. Even more coincidence is that in the mv, there were a wall of cube blocks, and the main character jumps through them like a minecraft animation.

0.0.1.12
12th music video is Luminize. Luminize like how lava was added to the version. In the single, there is also unlimited density which is bedrock.


0.0.1.13
13th music video is Two souls -towards the truth- which was produced in Netherlands. Netherlands is known for have land about the same level as water and smooth terrain generation. In the minecraft version, terrain generation is fixed to have land not always generate above water and that the terrain is smoother. Minecraft version also fix lava mechanics and lava, and netherlands have similar etymology. It is also the world size test which means land. 113 is named after a piece of land. And it is also japan which the music is in. Truth is data. and the minecraft version has level save which means that you can go towards the truth. Since there is no multiplayer, two souls means that the single player comes in 2 which is only possible by log out and log in.

14th music video is white forces. In minecraft version, water flows faster. Fast water is white, so it is white forces. The version adds gravel, sand, ore, log, and leaves. It is the first version that is compatible with my minecraft theory because bedrock→stone→gravel→sand→dirt and ores exist and log→planks. White forces is in the same album as 15th music video so they share those similarities. The importance of why it is important to be compatible to my minecraft theory is that white forces is in anime which I use to help with my minecraft theory even in 2023 version.

15th music video is 1983 schwarzesmarken. In it, is lyrics. I found that the lyrics best describes quartz which is added in 1.15 . I put notes into translated lyrics. Both 1.15 and 1.14 update are alike as in that they both focus on the nether. It is like that both 15th and 14th music video are in the same album.


Even in this world on the verge of collapse{all quartz are in ore}, I still dream of tomorrow
Keeping a believing heart within my chest, once again today, I bet on everything and fight

The faint glimmer that I have always dreamt of{quartz vein is is shiny}
Is the only connection{to other quartz ore veins} with the other side of the wall{wall as in the big pillars of netherrack}, across this grey sky{grey sky is nether roof}
All the grief and pain, are the proof of us being alive{wither spawning is the reason why the quartz in the netherrack decide to come together and form ore}
And those who think this way, are also protecting something right now{some are not believing because not all things in quartz ore are quartz}

In this age bound by unreasonable rules{unreasonable because it caused the quartz to be ordered randomly}
We will only cut across the darkness

Even in this world on the verge of collapse, I still dream of a tomorrow
Keeping a believing heart within my chest, I search for light
It’s just the truth in my heart, an indelible scar{scar referring to truth which means that heart pursues truth which means that quartz is intelligent}
Turning even that pain into hope{pain as in random electrical signals. turning something random to hope is intelligence}
The tale of the ongoing conflict will soon open up our destiny…!{soon as in 1.14 update}

Looking up into the hazy sky, thinking of the bygone days{some data is still preserved}
In this inescapable reality{it is a hardware problem}, an invisible wall blocks our freedom{invisible wall of red matter than prevents formation of more quartz}
Standing still in the maze of the etched memories{maze as in that structure of quartz ore is a maze}
Even so, I take a step forward, because I still have that day when I vowed

There’s no meaning to defining the righteousness
I just want to protect the bonds right before me{quartz is programmable}

Even in this crumbling city, I still want to connect to tomorrow
Filling my hands full with an unbendable spirit, I will protect you{quartz is programmable}
But just the truth in my heart, a yet to be seen dream
If only I can discover it
I will surely be able to overcome whatever despair that lies ahead of my path…{quartz believes that it is able to prove if something is true}

My promise with you strongly tightens our bonds{quartz is programmable}
The conclusion that resonates with the countless futures{quartz is programmable}

Even in this world on the verge of collapse, I still dream of a tomorrow
Keeping a believing heart within my chest, I search for light
This heart of mine on the brink of breakdown continues to long for you even now
I can never forget, the moment that I first met you{quartz was once written}
It’s just the truth in my heart, an indelible scar
Turning even that pain into hope
The tale of the ongoing conflict will carve in time{quartz is affected by current things}
Even in this crumbling world, I am still searching for light
Filling my hands full with an unbendable spirit, I will protect everything
But just the truth in my heart, a yet to be seen dream
If only I can discover it
I will surely be able to overcome whatever despair that lies ahead of my path…

I have notes of lyrics but I forgot where they belong:
_壊れかけたこの世界でまだ明日を夢見るから shows that the world hasn't broken down. which means that quartz still exists
_ずっと夢を見てた　僅かな煌きは describes quartz
_霞む空を見上げ　過ぎた日々を想う describes that it is in the nether
_刻んでる記憶の迷路に立ち尽くす describes nether quartz ore
_正しさの定義なんて意味はないけど is the reason why quartz can be used by anyone
_信じる心だけ今は胸に秘めて　光捜す quartz can be made into daylight sensor
