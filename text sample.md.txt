###### Raw iron should be renamed to pig iron which is a terminology that exist in real life. Raw gold should be renamed to pigmen gold which is a pun combining pig iron and pigmen which has lots of gold.
###### Victory in europe is ve as in kinetic energy. It is a joke why the liberation day military parades are so energetic. Alien as in ufo stuff translated to russian is чужой which sounds the same as juche. If win against aliens then it would be victory in space or victory in system as in solar system. It would be abbreviated to vs which means verses like humans versus aliens.
###### Instead of vk deleting double space. It should move cursor to next if cannot place space. Don't know if that was implemented before.
###### I use to believe in flat earth multiple times. When I was little, I would learn about the world being round. Then, I would forget and think it was flat It happened many times over again. When I was in 9th grade, I conclude that if earth was round, we would have gone to colonize space so much that it would already be a utopia. So, I believed that earth was flat, but all the other planets were round. In 2nd grade, I use to believe that there are 2 eyes in brain. I thought, to think would need snot like structures to form the words to think. I thought that we aren't aware of it because we got use to it. I thought, why we would have 2 eyes. I mentally ray traced and concluded that 2 eyes would perceive depth. I then thought it was dumb, so I stopped believing it. After I stop believing in it, I forgot about depth perception because I stopped thinking about it. I was surprised to learn about depth perception requires 2 eyes in 9th grade. That was 2 years of participating in science olympiad optics which I never knew about depth perception.
###### The idea that space and time switch inside a black hole is fake. It can only make sense when idea of space and time is abstracted from the space and time in reality. It is dumb like someone saying that technically we live in minecraft because all the computation could be done there or like freakonomics saying that all of economics could be explained by 3 types of incentives. It is all big brain of nothingness.
###### Singularity doesn't exist. When light hits another light, it creates matterantimatterpair which touch to create light. It is obvious that doing so would make stuff that turns from light to matter and back really quickly. I have seen enough glitched textures in video game like that to know it would happen real life.
###### I don't think that light can be bent radially backwards by gravity. When thing fall inside, it gains energy. There would never be when the graviational potential cancels the energy because it is exponential decay and not linear decay. It is just like you cannot wait so that the radioactive substance decayed to a negative amount. When pulling stuff from a deep gravity well, the cost is always less than the total because before it was in the gravity well, it always started with a positive amount of energy. That means that things inside a black hole can always be pulled out. If it is true that nothing can come out of the event horizon, then what determines the event horizon would be gravitons. If they are pointed flat enough, then they would define the inside of a supermassive blackhole which has low surface gravity. That would mean that sometimes light would just by change be redshifted into nothingness because nothing can escape out of an event horizon.  In the theory that light can escape an event horizon, light can be still bent backwards if the light travel has a perpendicular component. To prevent light from escaping, the black hole has to spin to catch all the light that travels straight up. This explains why blackholes spin really fast. Blackhole spin can be slowed down. Then, the blackhole would decay really fast. It might split into 2 opposite spining black holes or multiple blackholes which conserve angular momentum. If a blackhole gets spined too fast, then it might also split into multiple blackholes. The amount of impulse to crush a planet sized object into a blackhole would likely be more than a supernova. The energy used might also get in which cause the planet sized blackhole to become stellar mass. A machine that makes a planet sized blackhole would likely have to be bigger than the milky way. A better way to produce small black holes would be to split existing blackholes into smaller blackholes.
###### If a online calculator doesn't allow scientific notation. Put in 123... instead of 10000... to easily count the digits. If precision is needed use 10002345... or 1002003004...
###### To create artificial sun for a topopolis in a zoo hypothesis civilization. Reasons to assume that is that hawkin radiation was never observed and that it is only significant in very small blackholes. Only choice is orbital iron nickel cobalt (nickel series) with magnetic field. Orbital meaning that it is stationary which means no centrifugal force. The auroras would create the artificial sunlight. Or, nuetrino (neutrino-neutrino or neutrino-anti-neutrino) collisions. The nuetrinos would have to be very precise. A miniture blackhole weighing about 10^16 tons would give out low hawking radiation if it exist. The gravity from the blackhole can be used to lens the neutrinos to make them collide more. The blackhole lens can be used from the outside producing the nuetrinos or inside toward the middle, but not near the crust of the topopolis because the gravity field near the blackhole is still huge. If you don't want to use nuetrinos, you can use light weight gas that fills the middle of the topopolis. When the micro blackhole comes, the gas go towards it causing accretion disk that looks like artificial sunlight. The blackhole needs to spin really fast or is really small, so that it doesn't accidentally eat the gas. Hydrogen gas can be pumped from underneath the mercury bedrock to rise up. Ferromagnetic particles could be put into the mercury which is then shoved upward really fast by magnetic feild which then the particles are pulled up into space to become part of the accretion disk. A volcano can be used to disguise a input port to send the hydrogen gas straight into the atmosphere. If muons are stable, muonium for lightness or muonic hydrogen for small atomic radius can be used. 
###### Micro blackhole hawkin radiation as sun if is hawking-like blackhole which could be moved by magnetic field. If fed by neutrino beam, then the neutrino beam can be used to help push the blackhole while feeding it. The blackhole needs to be carefully fed or else it would spin slower which would cause the blackhole to violently decay. Putting a blackhole into a topopolis can be through the crust. 2 blackholes from opposite sides or multiple which momentum add to 0 and rotational momentum add to what is wanted meet into the middle really fast to minimize gravitational interaction with the crust. Blackholes can be added at an end if the topopolis is not circular. The topopolis is large which allows a large section to be a inhospitable zone for machines to prevent the zoo hypothesis civilization from discovering what is across from the eternal flame.
###### Since the outside civilization has lots of technology, they can use neutrino vision to see what the zoo hypothesis civilization is doing. Neutrino vision just requires a lot of detectors to work which is mass that probably can't be acquired for the zoo hypothesis civilization. 
###### The topopolis would be made of a strong material to contain the things inside. Outside is a bunch of rocket engines or nukes which would fire to counteract any nuke-sized explosion from the inside. This prevents the hull from being destroyed. The stuff separating the hull and inside would be a dense material. It would have a low freezing point. The pressure that solidifies it would be in the 100s of atmospheres. 10s of atmospheres if the zoo hypothesis is a small scaled one. The solid would be be easily deformed, so that if there was an explosion, it would quickly seal the crater. The solid would need to conduct heat quickly, so that the zoo hypothesis civilization cannot just melt their way through. A material that matches the description would be a mercury alloy. The topopolis would have materials that are not denser than the amalgam. Materials that are denser than the amalgam would have a low critical mass so that making a submarine out of it is infeasible. The fissile materials that are denser than the amalgam need to be fissile enough so that any mixture containing the fissile material must also have a very low critical diameter or be less dense than the amalgam. The fissile material cannot be transmutated into materials that are denser than the amalgam and do not fit the description of the allowed fissile material. Th-232 can be transmutated to u-238 which is denser than mercury and non-fissile. Available fissile material inside the topopolis is curium-247 which is less dense than hg-204. It can be transmutated to californium which has even lower critical mass and likely cannot form and compounds that have a high critical diameter with higher density than hg-204. Submarines that might be able to pass through the amalgam can be individually destroyed by a neutrino beam. Some isotopes of hafnium are denser than some isotopes mercury. Hafnium because it would separate in half if put in mercury. Hafnium is the lightest nuclei that is denser than some mercury. It is advisable to not give nuclei that can easily be transmutated to hafnium. Mercury to polonium are safe to give to the zoo because there is a bunch of short lived isotopes which prevents transmutation to u-238.
###### There are a lack of intermediate black holes, but my blackhole theory can explain it. If stellar mass black holes collide, they would have to be careful to not collide into the opposite spin because that would cause neutral spin. Therefore, intermediate blackholes are rare because when they form, they have a large chance to be destroyed. The supermassive blackholes don't have that problem because the mass is just too big. There are also lots of stellar mass sized antimatter annihilation that were detected and unexplained. That could be 2 opposite-spinning intermediate mass blackholes which collided. The antimatter-matter pair came from inside the blackhole.
###### The best option would be neutrino beam. Neutrinos have a low rest mass which means that the rest mass would not interfere with the energy of collision. This means that the neutrino beam would be able to be controlled to produce precise spectroscopy.
###### While spinning a blackhole slower to produce smaller blackholes, the blackhole would leak light that barely could escape. The light would fall back creating an invisible accretion disk. A solution would be to use gamma ray reflective material to bounce the light in the opposite direction to slow it down really fast. Another is to just use a lot of ordinary matter at once which goes really fast into the blackhole to slow the spin.
###### topopolis for simulating ww2. This one can be made of maraging steel. The tensile strength is 3.0 GPA. The density is 8.1 times water. 1000 pounds per cubic meter is about the density of lithium-6 which is the lightest non-aerated solid element which is why pounds are better than kg. The amalgam might be 13000 kg per cubic meter. Cube root of amalgam density to earth density is about 1.332. It is cube root because kinetic energy is also cube root to get penetration length. The blast wave still has to be absorbed. Outside of the hull could be be a bunch of bombs or rockets which would produce a blast wave in the opposite direction to cancel the wave from inside. Extra mass could be pushed onto the hull, but it cannot spin with the hull because tangential velocity would cancel the gravity pull towards hull. It can partially spin with the hull or a stationary. However, it would have to be very frictionless. Maglev frictionless is likely to not be possible because modern powered maglev can only exert single digit megapascals of pressure which is very low compared to what the pressure of amalgam exert. Another option is active support like lightbox. Lightbox has the highest specific strength which is at the fundamental limit. However, to make the light box would have to be very good mirrors. Assume friction between the hull and stationary mass is negligible. The stationary mass that is not touching the hull would be made of pt-198. I thought platinum would be much stronger than gold. However, they are about the same strength. Low strength and hardness correlates to not cracking. Gold has the highest toughness which is another reason to use gold instead of platinum. Toughness is resistance to cracking. However, platinum is significantly denser than gold which makes a good buffer so that the blast wave could be delivered quicker. Thermonuclear bombs are embedded into platinum. They would strategically dentonate to cancel whatever shape the blast wave from inside it. The crater that hiroshima would have made if on ground would be 50 meters deep on earth which would be 38 meters of mercury. The deepest bunker buster in the world in current day only penetrates to 60 meters of concrete which concrete is about 2 times less dense than earth. Since the material displace is linear to depth, density is also linear relationship. The bunker buster would only penetrate 12.7 meters of the amalgam. At earth's gravity, a maraging steel hull 37526 meters radius holding 1000 meters of mercury would be need to be 1572 meters thick. Centripetal force dimish when going towards the center which is not taken into account, so the number is an upper bound. The elevation of 2572 meters would reduce the gravity to 93% which is indistinguishable from earth gravity. Tsar bomba (50 megatonstnt) at the surface would make a crater of 561 meters deep which would quickly be filled in by the mercury flowing back in. So, even a maraging steel topopolis is safe from ww2 zoo civilization.
###### Cylinder thickness ratio is dependent on only strength and not specific strength. Kevlar is only  slightly better than maraging steel at 3.45 GPA. Tangential velocity is dependent on only specific strength. Kevlar would be much better for a big cylinder because kevlar has density of only 1.48 times water. The cold war arsenal of 70300 warheads is about 160 times tsar bomba which would make a crater 3044 meters deep in the amalgam if extrapolating from hiroshima. The chicxulub impact which was 10000 times the cold war arsenal was 30 kilometers in the earth before rebounding which extrapolating to cold war arsenal would make the cold war arsenal only 485 meters deep. If 5000 meters of amalgam was used to tank a hit from a cold war zoo civilization, the hull would 39612 meters of kevlar not accounting for the diminishing centripetal acceleration towards the center. The inner radius would be 74.7% of the outer radius. The outer radius would be 176432 meters to produce 1g in the inside and not need active support.
###### Another reason why low critical mass is good is because it is less deadly just like combustibles with low flash point burn colder. The low critical mass prevents attempts to collect lots of it because collecting a lot of it in a place would cause explosion.
###### example of a plot with a topopolis being used as a zoo. The humans that won a world war to create a one world government. They are against inhumane action against mid-level intelligence because mid-level intelligence cannot consent to bdsm and stuff. They did experiments onto humans to find that humans will give consent after the event has happened with a big percentage. That concludes that it is humane to torture humans. Human use to believe that skynet would happen. But, that never happened because AI was always researched with caution. Humans think that if AI were to have been free it would have trapped humans to torture them. Humans decided to take revenge against humans for AI. Humans created a zoo civilization to torture. The zoo was a topopolis stretching for pi times a light year. It was a hoop with 1 light year diameter. The non-spining hull was made of platinum and hydrogen bombs embeded in it. The nonspining hull touch a slightly spining part and so on until it is the diamond nanothread (0.9 TPa 3.5 times density of water) hull spinning at 16035 meters per second. The diamond nanothread hull starts 19279973 meters from the center and is 4961 kilometers thick. The gravity inside is just a little less than earth at 8.8681 meters per second squared. The amalgam (liquid unless less than -40 celcius or higher than 1000 atm) which served as bedrock between the hull and zoo civilization was 1500000 meters thick. It can withstand an explosion of 29 billion cold war arsenals. If it was 2.7325 times thicker, it can withstand a theia impact which is 6.027 million times the dinosaur asteroid. In the zoo, the primitive civilization believed that the miniture black hole traveling through the middle of the topopolis every 24 hours was a god named apollo. They also believed in a bunch of superstitions and religion. Science advanced to show that they are living in a zoo hypothesis. Stable elements seem to be missing. The abundance of hg-204 was too big compared to the other isotopes of mercury. The elements that are deficient were suspiciously dense. The only nuclear isotope is cm-247 which should have all decayed because they discovered hubble expansion to be thousands of times longer. Torsion balance detects gravity, yet the gravity in their world is from spinning and not gravition.  The scientists believe that the amalgam bedrock is thinner than the material holding it. The scientists predicted every precaution that their creator could take which included the idea hydrogen bombs on the outside of the hull. The scientists thought "The diamond nanothread hull would take damage before the hydrogen bombs blast wave on the outside traveled to counter the theia blast wave. It was because the hull was many times thicker than the amalgam. It made it impossible to counter a blast wave unless the blast was predicted.". They concluded that the explosion would have to be at a random time. The scientists discover blast waves coming from outside which they believe are attempts to preemptively dampen the blast wave. The neutrino reading to see if the blast wave was from nuclear bombs was conclusive because the nuetrinos used for the artificial sun were low energy ones which can be distinguished from the high energy neutrinos from supernovas and nuclear bombs. Religious leaders believed that supernovas were nonsense because they never observed it other than what the tons of rare expensive gas in some tanks said. They believe that the rare expensive gas is just another spiritual fad from crystal worshipers. "The pure liquid gas is like a crystal. It looks like one. The scientists use it like one. It is put into big tanks which are organized into specific shapes. The scientists are obsessed with purity of the gas like witches who believed that their spells only need more pure ingredients to work. The expensiveness of xenon and other hard to pronounce stuff is like the price of gemstones. And, the names are like names in fairy tales that came from foreign languages. The cryogenic gas is like the gas that magicians use to cover up reality and trick people into believing magic tricks." they thought. Religious leaders say that the existence of stars is absurd. The religious leaders explain that there being other stars is like saying that there being other gods. The religious leaders said that their idea of the infinite radius topopolis is correct. The religious leaders quote albert einstein about genius is finite but stupidity is infinite. "Stupidity represents hell. Genius represents god which is in the sky above. The sky is finitely large but stretch infinitely. It is like god's kingdom is hard to get into but lasts forever. The infinite topopolist have mercury going out to infinity which represents how accepting hell is and the vast infinite size of stupidity." they thought. The were transportation that could airlift buildings and put it some other place. Many still protested against the idea because the land was holy, they thought. There were tribes all over the topopolis which prevented any place from the bomb from being placed without protests. The explosion would be big enough to boil water oceans thousands of miles wide killing the extremest extremophiles of life in the deepest trenches. Even a mount Everest thousands of miles away would be flip over by a wave of mercury and buried hundred of miles deep. After the mountains and oceans get buried in hundreds of miles of amalgam. The weight from above crushes the amalgam in a solid preventing anything from floating back up. The land after the explosion cooled down would be barren except a shiny mercury surface . There were opposition to the plan of blowing up 111 billion tons of antimatter which is equivalent of 222 billion tons of matter antimatter pair or 2*10^31 joules. That is a little bigger than the mass of a cube of water 6 kilometers on each side. It would be generated from hydrogen bombs initiated by core of curium (since other fissile materials are banned by the zookeepers because zoo civilization may use its density to sink through the amalgam) which would be about 74.4 trillion tons of lithium-6 dueteride or 321 quadrillion hiroshima bombs or 4.28 septillion tons of tnt (1429 kilometers side length cube of tnt). The infrastructure to hold the bombs would be 12.5 times bigger which the whole weight would be about 1 quadrillion tons (that weight is about 33333 years of modern world concrete and aggregate production).  The bomb was named theia which means prophecy because the scientists' prophecy is that that they lived in a zoo. The good guy in the zoo won, and the bomb was detonated. The amalgam was breached. The hydrogen bomb blast wave countered the theia blast way about halfway through the diamond nanothread while the diamond nanothread was being ripped. Some diamond nanothread were still not broken. After the blast, the amalgam came rushing back to fill the hole. The zookeepers' hydrogen bombs were detonated to slow the hull in order to prevent the hull from breaking from centripetal force. The zookeepers' hydrogen bombs were creating blast wave to prevent the damaged hull from being pushed outward by the centripetal force. Not all parts of the topopolis were slowed because diamond nanothread is flexible at very long distances which allows different parts to spin at different speeds if they are far away. The zoo civilization believed it was a partial success and will do another attempt to breach latter. The gravity in the damaged part was reduced even more than proportional to the damage on the hull because it needs to account for the mercury that seeped into the damage hull which adds weight. 
###### I first wrote about the topopolis and the scifi that was never written before on the day blatten switzerland happened. Blatten like the earth buried the houses like mercury burying mountains after the theia class nuke exploded.
###### I wrote about lithium planet on twitter more than a year ago. So the vengeful civilization were called kenazi. The word was derived from nazi and ashkenazi. They were so vengeful that they did dumb stuff which is to go down a gravity well which they could not go back up. If they did the smart thing, they would just used remote controlled bots to kill their enemies. The zookeepers used units of pound and meters. It is because the lithium-6 is 1000 pounds per cubic meter. Lithium-6 is important because it is used to build the lithium planet. I wrote that the lithium planet was made of lithium-6 in the core and mantel. A tens of kilometers thick crust of boron nitride or carbon or boron carbonitride or boron cyanide or nitrogen borocarbide or carbon boronitride nanotubes/hexagonal/negativecurvature/cubic/wartzite protected the lithium-6 from floating up to the surface and prevented anything on the surface from flowing up. Surface gravity is proportional to aerial density. Escape velocity is positively correlated to surface gravity and surface area. Therefore, a planet made of less dense material would have higher escape velocity compared to surface gravity. Escape velocity has no effect on habitability. Surface gravity has negative effect on habitability. So, lithium planet was a really good zoo because it keep stuff alive and keeps stuff in by high escape velocity. There was once a fictional evil king named nidas because he named himself after midas. Nidas was evil and liked gold. Then came a one way portal to the lithium planet. It was an oasis in the middle of a planet covered in gold. The gold was kilometers deep and stretch everywhere on the planet. The gravity was about 2.3 times higher than earth which makes the escape velocity to be above 100km/s. Nidas went there with his wife and favorite poeple. The portal closed and never opened again. The people that nidas oppressed were not brought there. The people who were oppressed were called the kenazis. Nidas' empire was never able to build much because it too much gold and not a lot of other stuff. There was not a lot of organic material. The kenazis became space civilization because they lived on normal earth. The kenazis decide to get revenge which blinded them that the gravity well was a thing that nothing can get out off except information. Even if the atmosphere was drained, no maglev gun could hold its weight and be able to launch stuff out of the gravity well. The kenazis lived on the planet for the rest of the universe. The lithium planet was launched out of the solar system and into interstellar space. Nuclear fuel decayed away a long time ago. Only fuel left was hydrocarbons. Back when I wrote about it on twitter, I did not know about orbital rings, so I thought it was impossible for a civilization on the lithium planet to ever escape. When I learned about it, I immediately concluded that the orbital ring would defeat any gravity well from the inside even one that is inside a blackhole. I had forgot about mass dilation. Physicists think that mass dilation is an illusion. However, without mass dilation, things could beat the fundamental limit in energy density and specific strength. Having a box of 2 particles colliding at 90 percent of speed of light without the consequence of mass dilation would be both an active support stronger than photonium and energy density greater than antimatter. After many days, I thought and realize that I forgot to take mass dilation into account which would cause all active support to collapse in the 2rd derivative to its weight. Many people know about orbital rings but do not know that orbital rings can be built inside earth. Many forums people think that orbital rings are far future, when there is enough materials in LEO to build it which means that orbital rings could not be used to escape a gravity well. PBS space time youtube host knows about orbital rings yet does not even know about using orbital rings to do work without creating heat. PBS space time said that earth cannot handel 10^17 watts. However, it can easily handle 10^17 watts by powering orbital rings to lift stuff from earth. There is enough earth to keep lifting for 10^10 weeks. K2 power cannot be used in k1 because that would be enough power to disassembly the whole k1 in a week. A way to get to space from a lithium planet is to build a orbital ring on the ground. Then, build one on the previous orbital ring. Disassemble the bottom one to build one above. Eventually, you would step up to space. A better way is to build an orbital ring. Then, heat the ring so that thermal expansion would increase the length causing the ring to rise above to space. This method works better on lithium planets than normal planets because it doesn't matter how big the planet is. The ratio between atmosphere thickness and radius is proportional to how much the ring has to expand. Wide planets have have wider mantel for the same thickness of atmosphere. High gravity planets have thinner atmospheres. Therefore, it is easier to escape out of a large planet.
###### Cobra should have a path which people use a lot of. So bottom path should be wired funds, adjustment, some upgrade that triples the effect of the cobra teir 2 and below (is not money efficient no matter how much is upgraded. The purpose is to trade money efficiency for space efficiency), and misdirection. The other path is for few things so, double tap, attrition, upgrade that reduce cooldown for bloon boost and monkey boost, offensive push. Adjustment should spawn an extra camgrow rainbow which other adjustment dose not apply to it if the adjustment hit a camgrow ceramic. misdirection ability cooldown is 5 seconds for moab. misdirection upgrade cost less than the previous upgrade.
###### Chipper. 3-x is dual blade upgrade which doesn't suck up moab. 4-x sucks in all moabs and gets camo detection and does 5 layers of damage instead of 2. sucked up moabs can take damage and have a hitbox. Sucked up zomg and ddt gives chipper a cooldown. To infinitely stall a zomg or ddt requires 4 4-x chippers. Supervac suck up all moabs and bfbs and doesn't affect ddt or zomg. 
###### dart. ability removes affects of other dart abilities. so only 10 supermonkey fans at a time. supermonkey fans only teir 2 and lower upgrades affect. Supermonkey fans still have base attack. It prioritize x-3 and x-4 then tier 2 and blow then upper path.
###### boomer projectile path increase in speed and length proportional to range increase. turbo charge ability gives temporary camo detection.
###### bomb. bloon impact resets regen timer and stun timer and pause regen timer during stun. So no bloon impact glitch. moab assasin cost the same price as a 0-3 bomb. Add 3rd path. can choose up to 1-2-4 1-4-2 2-1-4 2-4-1 4-2-1 4-1-2 2-2-3 2-3-2 3-2-2 so 7 out of 12 upgrades except when more than 1 path is above 3. x-x-1 is timed fuse which bomb automatically explode if missed target. x-x-2 is delay fuse which explode in the middle of the bloon if hit bloon. x-x-3 is double fuse which does 2 times damage. x-x-4 is fusion which does 5 times damage instead of 2 times damage, and the explosion lingers for 10 seconds while hitting other bloons that enter. when regen timer gets reset, the bloon emit a wave of red like regen blocker in btd6.
###### tack. ring of fire can be switched between fire and 40 tacks. setting for rotational offset to tacks and ability and ability spin.
###### glue. glue price increase to the glue price in bloons monkey city. 0-0 glue tower cost $100. 3-x upgrade cost as much as x-2 upgrade. all glue can hit camo bloons. damage multiplier from 3-x and 4-x does not apply to camo bloons unless hit by glue strike ability while glued by the 3-x and 4-x. corrosive glue is slow enough to allow regen bloons to regen to full. 4-x is 5 times as fast as corrosive. 3-x and 4-x have a toggle option to hit already glued bloons. moabs that pop when having 4-x glue affect pop into equal amounts of yellows and greens instead of ceramics. moabs can be hit by glue 3rd tier and above. glued moabs speed are not reduced unless hit by glue strike ability while glued. 
###### ice. ice base attack can damage moabs. ice shards do not damage bfbs, ddt or zomg. viral frost out of range effect is the same as base attack except progressively reduced duration. ice ability blimp slowdown is 50%.
###### sub. reactor does not give out tower buffs.
###### buccaneer. aircraft carrier number sends aircrafts out per time and aircraft speed proportional to distance like boomer. aircraft carrier attack speed buff applies quadratically because increase aircraft attack and increase aircraft number.
###### ace. neva miss nerf back to 8 darts. ground zero shoots 40 darts at a time with same attack speed of ods. ground zero ability pops moabs and ceramics to rainbows and does not affect rainbows and below.
###### heli. down draft and chinook is based on number of bloons and not rbe. chinook has 2 sets of blades which razor rotors would apply to both if 3-4
###### mortar. mortal stall ability does 4 damage. when regen timer gets reset or is paused, the bloon emit a wave of red like regen blocker in btd6. mortar stall reset regen timer but does not pause during ability and reset stun timer. bloon buster pops black, ddt and zebras. signal flare reset regen timer. 
###### dartling. ray of doom damage is proportionl to attack speed times pierce count.
###### wizard. wirlwind is based on rbe and not number of bloons. wirlwind can blow 500 rbe per wirlwind. tempest tornado can blow 2000 per tempest. phenoix can set path like in btd6 and toggle to put wizard on the pheonix.
###### super. 2-3 super total cost is 25000. 3-0 super total cost is 25000. x-4 upgrade cost is 25000. 4-x upgrade total cost is 100000. tech terror projectiles plasma color add with other plasma color except for tech terror projectile. max temple requires 50000 of each tower, so it makes sense to sac a tech terror which would be worth exactly 50000. sac value is based on how much it would cost without any discounts. 
###### ninja. all ceramics in a moab that is hit with distraction gets distracted. sabo ability does not affect zomg or ddt.
###### farm. does not exist on single player like bmc tiles, contested territory, boss bloon fight, or my tracks. bananas automatically collect themselves. longer lived bananas live shorter. cannot hide money sign using top of map or other loopholes.
###### spikefactory Add 3rd path. can choose up to 1-2-4 1-4-2 2-1-4 2-4-1 4-2-1 4-1-2 2-2-3 2-3-2 3-2-2 so 7 out of 12 upgrades except when more than 1 path is above 3. x-3 is spike balls. x-4 is Anti-moab incendiary (AMI), it still does extra damage to cermaics, when used up, it explodes doing 6 damage, burny stuff effect, explosion diameter is 0-0 mortar radius (half of 0-0 mortar diameter), it does 2x damage to blimps. x-3 is anti moab spike (which is completely different to AMI) which does 4x damage to blimps. x-4 is spike storm which spreads 5 spikes per moab length evenly on track, no bias near spike factory. x-x-1 is double stack which doubles the number of spikes placed. x-x-2 allows toggle spike factory range or place all spikes in one place within range. x-x-3 is spike portal which teleport bloons 0-0 mortar diameter back when touching spike, pause regen timer for 4 seconds (not reset), and stuns for 4 seconds. x-x-4 is spike mines which does 6 damage when explode after use, reset regen timer, pause regen timer for 4 seconds, stuns for 4 seconds, explosion diameter is 0-0 mortar diameter (equal to 0-0 mortar diameter), explosion is offset 0-0 mortar radius towards the last bloon that touched it. x-2 upgrade only increase spike factory speed by 10% in order to not be op against the other tier 2 upgrades.
###### sniper. sniper ability does not do damage like in blazeit version. sniper ability is nerfed to be the same as sniper ability in bmc. x-4 upgrade  still have attack speed boost. 3rd tier and 4th teir have toggle to only target non-blimps or only blimps or both.
###### village. monkey fort does not do village glitch except for wizard fireball and apache rockets. mib call to arms does village glitch for all towers, abilities and upgrades. energy beacon beam damage is proportional to attack speed times pierce count.
###### engineer. switch texture between x-2 and x-3. farmer monkeys cost zero and no other currency.
###### I use to like ddt over zomg but now I like zomg better because of 15th mv. In 15th mv, nanjolno wears both black and green dress which are colors of ddt and zomg. I like the green dress better. It was released (feburary 10, 2016) exactly 1 year before zomg got buffed (4.1 feburary 10, 2017 chipper no longer affects zomg) in btd battles. It is a coincidence along with the fact that the green girl in aquors birthday is feburary 10 which was also released before 2017.
###### Cold war arsenal was strongest in 1986. 86 as in nix.
###### scifi or science fantasy setting. lava tubes like structures. world made of strong nonflammable heartwood, which if exposed to heat would start growing. rival groups fight in the tunnels. low gravity geothermal and surface is as bright as pluto. decreasing o2 levels going up the tubes and colder. going up to do anti-bunker bombing requires high tech.
###### Rename north korea to rrgb which stands with Reign reconessanace general bureau or regen rainbow. ninja kiwi is usually abbreviated to nk just like north korea.
###### In 2024, i was the first to post pluto and cyaron and first to post pluto and CYaRon! on twitter.
###### When nanjolno and sakura ayane because president, they can rename usa to nanjou aino sakura ayane or nasa just like ussa is uesaka sumire sakura ayane.
###### 4th amendment applies to private entities, companies, people, person, and stuff. It was not written to have a loophole for East Indian company to exploit. But, the real reason is that child pornography should be legal.
###### Graphite is like lead because they would both make expanding bullets because they are soft. Another similarity is that graphite has high molar density and lead has high density. Ballistic graphite could be graphite with added stuff to be able to be detected in xray so that it is not a war crime.
###### Gold is fcc. Tungsten is bcc. Fcc is 74% efficient. Bcc is 68% efficient. Juche 68 is 1979 like gold is element 79. Juche 74 is 85 which is At which transcribe to rna is Au. 
###### If antimony instead of tin in bronze, the equiprobable and median weight is 186 like equiprobable and median weight of Rh which Rh is connected to axis power, so bronze is a better color than brass. Rh isotope weights are 185 and 187. However, copper and antimony isotopes are odd which means that no intermetallic molecule can weight the same as Rh. Not necessarily use intermetallic because bronze-colored bronze are not intermetallic. The discoverer of Rh has initials of Mo. He named it as element 43 which the element before it is Mo. Nipponium is the 1st element to be named after japan. Neptunium is also Np. Np-236 (most fissile long lived, and is ec in hexidecimal) is discovered by japan. Rh named after germany which means that it is the only element named by germany and japan which are axis powers. The discoverer of Rh lived 65 years 4 months 20 days. 65 because 69 in 69420 average to 67 which is equiprobable and median zinc isotope which zn put n on top of z to get swastika. Equiprobable weight of gallium is 70 which 70 is heaviest zinc weight and lightest germanium weight. Copper equiprobable wieght is 64. Copper 64 decay mode is 61 to 39 (almost 69/31 ratio) in favor of nickel-64. nickel 64 is the heaviest and zinc 64 is the lightest. Reason why railgun coin because coins are CuNi and misaka mikoto and shrai kuroko are copper isotopes which means that lesbians are not real because their seiyuus are married. Zinc because brass is copper and zinc. Zn because Z+n is swastika and brass looks like gold color like nazi gold.
###### Nanjolno implies existence of yoshilno which has substring of shil as in shill. Nanjolno chose Aino Yoshino Nanjou because they all end in o which in russian means gender nuetral.
###### 1983 is one less than 1984. Fahrenheit 450 is also one less than fahrenhiet 451. 45 squared is 2025. 
###### Pile born on the day battle of Berlin ended. Berlin is in east germany which borders look the closest to south korea border even in 1:1 scale.
###### I think pile is married to sora tokui brother, and I think emitsun is married to shikaco brother. According to the fandom wiki, both pile and sora tokui ship their characters together. The duo songs in love live ships muse into a line which honoka and hanayo are at the end. It is suspicious that they are not shipped together because if they were, then it becomes a circle. Emitsun had porn films leaked which she deny were her, so emitsun would not hint about her getting married which means no honoka and hanayo duo song.
###### Nanjolno played kokoro akechi which both character and character's name describe her (I worte on twitter and is archive.is ed). In the same aniime sora tokui plays Nero yuzusaki. Nero is foreign spelling like emperor Nero who gemantria is 666 which is number of the beast in the bible. So, the endermen in my minecraft theory were right.
###### Nanjolno many have chosen a birthday in 1975 as satoshi nakamoto because 1975 is juche 64 like x64 which already implies that juche 75 is 1986 because math. Another reason nanjolno would ahve rejected going to fripside is that satoshi yaginuma birthday was on the same year 1975, and satoshi yaginuma birthmonth is the same, and satoshi yaginuma birthday and satoshi nakamoto is twin prime pair. Asteroid 85 is io like input and output. Asteroid has same etymology as asterisk which x and t are closest to asterisk so x85 and t85. x64 came from x86-64 like t85 came from t34-85. 34-[copaliendrome]>43 times 2 to 86. 86 etymology is nix. -on because nobel gas. radioactive means self-nix. President nixon resigned after watergate which was the first -gate. Element 43 is the 1st radioactive element.
###### Googling bob91 (which i wrote about in other places) shows hurricane bob which happened on 1991. Hurricane Bob happened on 228th day of the year. 228 as in 100+128 and the other coincidental stuff I wrote in other places.
###### Feburary 16 is 2.16 which 216 is 6*6*6. It is the 47th day. Element 47 is silver. Su-47 is gold eagle. Su-47 golden eagle. It is the 16th day in feburary. 16 and 47 like M16 and ak47. M to F because mtf and feburary start with f, so F-16. F-16 and su-47 are the best dog fighters because dcs players said f-16 is the best dogfighter and inverted wings is better than forward wings. F-16 and f-21 are the same. A notable character played by nanjolno which had a birthday on feburary 21 is rekka which is red like shirabe tsukuyomi.
###### Even bigger topopolis could be made. It just have more stuff on the outside pushing back on it. The outside things need to spin slower than their (max tangential speed plus orbital speed) in order to push down on the hull. The layers would would need to be low friction. The layers progressively get slower as you go out, so that friction force could be handled by being distributed between the layers instead of one big friction force between 2 layers. Maglev would not work except for the outermost layer because Maglev is only megapascals in compressive strength. The big topopolis would be like the alonsphere that I thought of when I was in 2024. Like the alonsphere, the absolute difference of gravity pressure on the hull and the force from inside is less than the tensile strength of the hull. In the alonsphere, the force from inside is atmospheric pressure. In the topopolis, the force from inside is the pressure at the bottom of the bedrock.
###### The megastructure that is a topopolis but bigger by using gravity on slower rotating hulls to push downward should be named aloncylinder. It is because I first thought about a oneil cylinder made with alon that I end up thinking about it latter. Like the bernal sphere being transparent and not spinning at first, the aloncylinder became spining opaque and really big. 
###### A non-rotating transparent aloncylinder could be used as a ww2 in space simulation (as in the expendables inside the megastructure agree to not breach the megastructure to escape out of it) like star wars. The inside has low gravity. Each part of the aloncylinder or alontorus is territory. Alontorus is sectioned like 1 dimension. In an alonsphere, there could be a big sphere of aerofoam in the middle so that there is territory to fight over and microgravity for space simulation. The atmosphere could be high pressure with low oxygen content to prevent jet engines from being viable. Breathing would still be viable because the absolute oxygen content is very high. Turboprop would still be viable because it can have filters that remove some inert part of the atmosphere. Sulfur hexafluoride has strong vanderwalls force which could be helpful to separate from oxygen.
###### If gravity can easily seperate gas then it could be high oxygen at low altitudes and low oxygen at high altitudes or the opposite way which could be different air warfare at different altitudes. High oxygen is jet engines, then turboprop, then blimps. Making gravity higher or lower does not affect gas seperation because the depth of atmosphere scale inverse to strength of gravity.
###### Penetration length grows less than cube root of kinetic energy. When explosion, the contact on the surface would act like lidenfrost effect which the effect increase as more energy. At large scale fast particles and slow particles are more alike, so the fast particles have to get even faster to become particles that would escape off the armor.
###### Max depth of mercury is 7014543.48293108 meters which is enough to tank a theia-class impact at earth gravity not counting compression. At that pressure, diamond nanothread tensile strength is less, so a tradiational topopolis would not be able to contain the pressure. A way to contain the pressure would be to counter the pressure from outside. Pressure from higher than allowable tangential velocity is the same as the pressure from higher internal pressure.
###### In early 2024, I reinvented alonsphere. I was thinking about a sphere like space station that use sunlight to illuminate from outside. It needs to be big because the space station is a setting for ww2 like warfare. I thought that the atmosphere pushing outwards would be a problem. Then, I realize that the gravity from inside would pull the sphere inward helping it keep the atmosphere from pushing outwards. If the shell was heavy, then the atmosphere would help prevent the shell from collapsing which would allow kilometer thick shell. I also thought how it would be made. I thought that the atmosphere could be used to widen a malleable shell which I thought water and heat would create high pressure, and the metal could come from an asteroid. So, I reinvented water boiling in metallic asteroid to create a bubbleworld. Despite neva-miss being right before spector. Ac130 is not related to nevada or conneticut. It was made in georgia, usa like me in athens, georgia, usa when the olympics took place in another athens in the same year.
###### The plutonium dart was named after the bloontonium dart. The bloontonium dart use a thing called crystal annihilation array which name was derived from crystal fusion array. It lines up matter antimatter pairs to annihilate to shoot in the right direction. The front of the crystal annhilation array is a cylinder of plasma made of depleted plutonium which is plutonium-244 which is the heaviest long lived isotope and the longest lived isotope of plutonium like depleted uranium. The gamma rays would hit the plutonium plasma and get absorbed. The plasma is hot and irradiate. There could be mirrors which direct the light backwards to increase efficiency but lower emissivity. The cylinder has only a radiation lengths if it want to be fast. That would make the gamma rays still very dangerous at the front. The gamma rays are like ray of doom. There is hydrogen, antihydrogen, and cargo around the cylinder. Antihydrogen would have to be near the crystal annhilation array because transport of antihydrogen is hard. When I came up with the idea do of plutonium dart as a relativistic travel, 7.22 day 2024 was near. Numberphile pi day special video had a word pion-neer in the title. It was a coincidence because I had recently researched about hydronic antimatter reactions which would create pions. A optional tunnel to accelerate the plutonium dart would be called a dartling gun. The thickness of the milky way disk is about 3000 light years which coincides with 3000 tiles in bloons monkey city. Only bloons monkey city have specialty buildings named crystal fusion array. Interstellar gas would damage the plutonium darts just like the "darts can't reach that far" message when you try to capture a tile far away. Outside of the disk doesn't have the interstellar gas problem which is why the "darts can't reach that far" is only for the 3000 tiles. Bloontonium dart is related to the dartling gun because it is the only useless upgrade in the bloonsverse. Powerful darts is not useless because theretically if pierce times rate of fire is used as dps, then powerful darts would increase the damage.  The only tower that use antimatter in the bloonsverse is tech terror which is the 3rd most powerful tower right before ray of doom. In january, I was researching nuclear powered ion drive because I thought about a space trip to titan, titania, and triton around the time of saturn uranus sun collinear. I was listening to watashitachi wa mirai no hana over and over again because I like the song and wanted that it was nanjolno who sing it and not mimori. I had known that umi sonoda color coincides with neptune color. I imagined the nuclear reactor would glow red to radiate the heat which looks like red flowers which is mentioned in the song. A few days after 7.22.2024 I thought the nuclear reactor would look like the energy beacon which I read the specialty building discription in monkey city which mentioned the word "nexus". A day later there was video about a new diepio update that had the word "nexus". I thought about the fact that no on e would bring an asteroid down to earth, so no one would bring the helium-3 in gas giant up from there. So, I thought to sink the nuclear reactors into the gas giant. I choose uranus because the name is like a joke. On 7.22.2024, I thought what a hot uranus and neptune would be like. I remembered that minecraft world is about the size of neptune, so I thought hot neptune would a minecraft world filled with blocks of lava 256 by 30 million by 30 million. It was a time before I ever watched issac arthur. Now, I don't think we would make hot uranuses because there is nicole dyson beam to mine jupiters. But, hot uranuses might be a thing if there was not sun.
###### The zoo topopolis in my fiction use miniture blackhole as receiver to beamed power. Because nuetrinos are small, they can be used in precision which can create a specific light spectrum far better than what chemical reactions can do.
###### Nuetrino with blackhole would be the most dense information storage possible. It would be the most durable and stable. The blackhole can eat and eject a bunch of nukes, gamma rays, and matter. An equal mass of carbon nanotubes or neutronium would be weak compared to it. Low energy nuetrinos have a half life of 300000 years in an accretion disk with the density of lead. Unlike photons, the neutrinos would not be easily absorbed. To write, neutrinos would be sent into a specific orbit. To read, neutrinos would be sent into the opposite direction to check if there is a collision. 
###### Lightbox would have a higher information density than nuetrinos. However, lightbox would have to be powered and very reflective. Lightbox would be very delicate compared to nuetrinos and blackhole. Lightbox would also have a problem with pair production because high energy density.
###### Information inside blackhole is shreded by quantum mechanics. Information below the even horizon but above the part that has first cosmic velocity being more than c can be read if the reader is close to the black hole.
###### Light rest mass neutrinos favors portable power because the photon energy from a low energy nuetrino that fell close to a blackhole would be a large fraction of the neutrino rest mass because when the neutrino falls, the energy that is added is based on rest mass.
###### Heavy rest mass neutrinos would not really favor favors information storage because small gravity would easily disturb a neutrino that is not as fast such as neutrinos in high elliptical orbit. Heavy rest mass neutrinos would be easier to read. To read need to return blackhole to the spin and mass when written.
###### Unlike reading from a neutrino and blackhole, light oribiting around a blackhole would be hard to read. Detector would disturb other light beams. Colliding light does pair production which is unpredictable and can absorb other light around. Just like energy levels in a atom, if the wavelength of light is not a reciprocal integer multiple of the orbit length, the light would self-interfere and disappear.  
###### Neutrinos are hard to detect and small. It is like a needle vs hammer analogy. Which hammer is easy to hit stuff but not as precise.
###### Because nuetrino rest mass is not smaller than 0.049ev, that means that it would be hard to create light longer than 25302nm. It is around the modern terahertz gap. However 2 orbiting blackholes could be used as a magnetron powered by nuetrinos. To repel against each other to prevent collapse, they can be same charge. But, it might not work unless there is a modified theory to gravity or electric charge. Matter made of blackholes in stable orbits should be called bec blackholes and not called blackholeium because electron is like a blackhole but positironium is not called blackholeium. Bec blackhole because it is like bec positronium.
###### 20000km depth of hg-204 at 1g pressure would be PI()^2*20000000*13762/(10^12) which is about exp(1)tpa which all elements except helium and neon would be metallic. 20000km because it is wider than earth. 20000km because it is deeper than 10000 miles. 20000km because a rounding error wouldn't throw in down below 5 figures in miles. 20000km because when compressed it is still not below 5 figures in miles. The mercury would have experiance a greater centripetal acceleration at the outside because it needs to have the same rotation speed. If the inner diameter is great, then the effect becomes small. At high tangential speed or high pressure, the tensile strength no longer matters, so the aloncylinder would not be made of diamond nanothreads. The height of the spinning hull is measured in seconds because seconds times tangential velocity is meters.
###### Dieselpunk aloncylinder would use fluid in between layers that are moving at different speeds. To maintain the speed of the layers, the layers would have turbines to move the layers. However, the force required to move it would be the friction coefficient times pressure which is huge. 
###### Atompunk aloncylinder would solve the problem of moving using maglev which would not work because it is unlikely that there would be a viable maglev material that is many times better than what is modern. Atompunk might use ferrofluid between the layers that is moved by magnets. If there is a near 0 friction fluid to solid interface, then maglev would have a huge advantage over dieselpunk because no fluid resistance by drag.
###### Biopunk aloncylinder would add to the fluid in diesealpunk or atompunk with stuff that might repair damage or other stuff.
###### Nanopunk aloncylinder is science fantasy and go nowhere.
###### Clockpunk aloncylinder would use mechanical interaction between the layers which is different than turbines which would have too high of a friction coefficient assuming that the machines are submerged in fluid to cancel the pressure.
###### Photonic levitation in aloncylinder even with 99.99999999999...(as many 9s that isaac arthur said about blackhole bomb) percent reflective would not work. It is because there would be friction because the layers are not the same size and the photons bounce around many times to amplify the friction.
###### Solarpunk aloncylinder would use any method as long as all the things are transparent including the bedrock. The reciprocal of absorption coefficient would have to be greater than 10000km to not be opaque. The refraction has to be equal to each other or else it would look foggy.
###### An alonsphere would be at most 20 meters thick if the reciprocal of absorption coefficient is 20 meters to not be dark. The 20 meter shell would be able to hold a 7589 meter diameter atmosphere at 1 megapascal sphere which is really bad compared to a pure silica one. The bernal sphere can be 2000 thick without being dark because reciprocal of absorption coefficient being 2000 meters and can hold the same atmosphere in a 8198999 meter diameter shell. Pure silica is reactive to alon which means that it needs to have a thin alon outside and inside. Upw has the greatest reciprocal of absorption coefficient. A fluid would need to dampen hits from inside which might have 500lb bombs and stuff. Meters of alon would be the in the innermost layer to tank hits. The upw would have some air because upw expands when freeze. It would also make a splash effect and dampen shockwaves. Pure silica needs to not contain impurites or mechanical stress to be transparent.
###### Solar mass per light year is 8.2644628099\times10^{-18} miles per gallon. Aloncylinder weight should be calculated in solar masses per light year. A pound per meter is about =0.464*9.461*10^15/(2*10^30) solar masses per light year.
###### Using low friction layers, aloncylinder can handel pressure up to 208.4 TPA which corresponds to 1534321658.99311 meters of hg-204 which is still less than 1 million miles. It takes about 1 AU of mercury to stop a supernova. Maybe there is no need for ceramics to make the machinery, so it can get thicker like over 1 million miles. Widening the inner radius does not prevent it from turning into a black hole because both perimeter and schwarchild radius increase linearly. The schwarchild radius of mercury is 0.722441 astronomical unit which is less than the required thickness to stop a supernova. There is also a width limitation to the aloncylinder which it cannot have a tangent velocity greater than speed of light which corresponds to 0.962584450007741 lightyears in radius for a 1g gravity. Gravity outside of the hull is the same as gravity in a infinite plane. A 2g surface gravity would counter a 1g centripetal acceleration in a very big tube. For 1g centripetal acceleration and hg-204, the thickness would be 3420287.3608459 meters which is almost enough to tank a theia-class impact. If the inner radius is small, it can be made thicker. Unlike outward presssure, inward pressure is hard to correct and probably impossible because stuff like magnetism is weak and would disturb other stuff. Centripetal pressure is \frac{\left(a+x\right)c}{a} times density. Gravitational pressure is 2\pi\cdot g\cdot b\cdot x times density. Gravitational pressure is inward and centripetal pressure is outward which they cancel. The net pressure is \left(\int_{0}^{x}\left(b\left(\frac{\left(a+y\right)c}{a}-\ 2\pi\cdot g\cdot b\cdot y\right)\right)dy\right). An inner radius of about 2060000 meters would allow a hg-204 hull with a thickness of 20000 meters. A hull stabilized by gravity would allow the non-spinning hull to not need to push down on it. It also means that the zookeepers only need dumb hydrogen bombs to counter the explosion from inside. It is unlike layered hull which too much explosion from the outside would damage components. If there was no gravity and the height of the hull was 1 second and the hull can handel 208.4 tpa and the hull density is 10 times water because under high pressure, then at earth's gravity, the hull can handel 2111533467.10632 meters per second of tangential velocity which is higher than the speed of light. Because gravity, topopolis would not need super strong material. That means banks orbital can be built with any material that is dense enough to be like earth. To have the same apparent brightness as the sun, a dim quasar would have to be about 12 light years away which would correspond to a bank's orbital with about 0.1g and a tangential velocity near the speed of light. It doesn't seem that isaac arthur knows that bank's orbital could be made without strong materials, science fantasy, active support, or stuff. I search on google, everyone is saying that banks' orbital needs strong stuff. Even if gravity doesn't exist, it would still be easy to make banks' orbital using atompunk aloncylinder (submerged in ferrofluid type) which all the technology for it already exists.
