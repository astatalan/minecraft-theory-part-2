According to other minecraft theories, blue is important because it is the color of lapis lazuli, and lapis lazuli is worshiped in woodland masions and used in enchantments. However, I believe that it is because that the minecraft world was once a nuetron star and nuetron stars are blue. In a more recent tweet, I explain that evokers come from clockwork planet anime which uses the color blue. But also, the theory that blue is the color of the uv catastrophy that humans can percieve (source (vsauce video): https://www.youtube.com/shorts/bPWExuQLtUA ) (also note that infinite temperature would produce the same spectrum as uv catastrophe)

A repeat of that blue is a important color.

The theory that dragon heads were hunted is in conflict about how I explain the ender dragon in my 2023 minecraft theory. I offer the explaination that the dragon heads are fake.

ender pearls are blue because their souls release uv catastrophe since their souls are magic and not quantum.

opposite of blue is brown which is why soul sand is brown, since soul sand sucks in blue endermen souls.

I connect my 2 theories of blue together into one.




#### prismarine blocks

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756409889801269306

I theorize that prismarine follows the pattern of a nuetron star that once was the minecraft world. However, I haven't been able to theorize why until april 3rd, 2024. It is also coincidence that the light blue girl in nijigasaki's birthday is also here. more would be found on the tag "#### more coincidence of 1.8" on minecraft theory new april 3.md



#### ancient debris in minecraft, since tau particles are heavier than protons making then too dense.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756436172903964961

This is the first time ever that I or anyone reason that ancient debris is made from muonic matter. muonic matter
turns diamond into lonsdaleite because muonic matter is very dense.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756437908272161059

I disagree again minecraft devs, because if it was true then ancient debris being scattered because of nanjou yoshino effect (a effect that acts on redstone which I theorized in the comment section on april 14 2023) would conflict.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756438475518210426

I used this explaination on how ancient debris could have formed. The information that the reader should conclude is that netherite decays and the muons scatter, then the nanjou yoshino effect concentrate them again forming ancient debris.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756439891695522212

Gold has relitivistic effects, so I thought of a way which is that the electrons get replaced with muons and then the relitivistic effects on the muons give it the ability to deform diamond into lonsdaleite.


source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756581616237879412

It cannot be tauonic matter because tauon are heavier than protons which would make it too dnese to have a valance shell.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756583238904979854

Another reason why gold is that muons are attracted to heavier isotopes and gold is a very heavy isotope.

Since iron does not have relitivistiic properties like gold, the muons  would sink into the inner electron shells and have no effects on valence shell which would make the muon properties unusable.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756593718268661873

nether has higher strange quarks that overworld (which I wrote in my minecraft theory 2023). Then, I conclude that strange quarks have enough mass to decay into muons, therefore there are more muons in the nether. THen, I explain that an attacting force also exists in muon.


#### eye of ender

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756504737371799576


Repeat of how I theorized the functions of eye of ender and end portal frame. But, I conclude that I don't know why it is called eye of ender.

#### endermen life cycle

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756509016878985380

Taking into account that: endermen decompose into soul sand, endermen do not want soul sand because soul sand creates wither, and when endermen die, they bury themselves in a ender pearl to prevent themselves from turning into soul sand. 

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756781314764619879

I conclude that endermen hates water because endermen knows that water can cause decay and corrosion. And if water corrodes an endermen body (even if it is a small amount), the particles would turn into soul sand.

#### endermen eyes

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756746068358729772

Endermen eyes are influenced by the purple aerosuits in schwarzesmarken. Therefore, they are purple.



#### importance of emeralds

source: source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756757198292582403

I conclude that villagers like emeralds because of etymology. emeralds are beryllium compound. beryllium has berry (which is a sweet thing) and also has another name "glycium" named after sweetness. sweet is connected to children because children are known to be greedy for surgar.



#### minecraft purgatory

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756781314764619879

In between heaven and hell is earth. I conclude that endermen in ender pearls have afterlife in niether heaven nor hell




#### minecraft allays

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756795607404925358
source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756798143029444639

I was watching about matpat's minecraft theory on allays (source: https://youtu.be/lCwKdYbPvho?t=651 ). Then I reasearched more about allays and found out that allays accept amythests. I realize amythests are made of iron, silicon, and oxygen (the 3 innermost layers of a supergiant star less than 1 day before supernova), so I was really excited that I found it out and posted it really quick. I later posted about 100 more tweets that day (feburary 11, 2024) to connect me and Nanjolno using coincidences and etymologies about astronomy.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756836292258644367

also on the same day made a peom because allay and alloy sound similar.







#### quantum in minecraft theory

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756779631393350143

I used quantum mechanics to explain the unbreaking enchantment in my 2023 minecraft theory.


#### wither achievement 

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756846510728261652

There are 2 minecraft acheievements for spanwning the wither (Begining?) and killing the wither (Begining.). While searching for a reason why (other than begining is the opposite of end), I concluded that Begining has the same etymology as Neon, which neon is an element that if a star creates it, then it is very likely to go supernova (die).

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756851879818952940

I try to make the connection in etymology between minecraft wither achievement and stellar evolution obvious

#### beacon

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756850585913975110

I connect minecraft beacons to stellar evolution.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1756888688435319081

Obsidian (used to make beacons) has the same chemcial formula as amythest. Except obsidian comes from volcanos, and volcanos are known to contain sulfur. Which I used it to connect sulfur to stellar evolution. Also it is true that sulfur is produced along with silicon burning and that silicon turns into sulfur before turning into iron. And that sulfur follows the power of 2 like oxygen.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1758492024465244275

This time the connection between the wither achievements (Begining?) (Begining.) is that the below neon burning shell is all the ingredients for a beacon



#### dragon egg

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759844790202511755

being useless allowed my minecraft theory to work. else, I would have a hard time connecting the white forces chorus to ender dragon

#### bed

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759847007999410471

According to my minecraft theory in 2023, Beds are mig-21 and the ender dragon is mig-23. Since, it takes 4 bed explosions to kill an enderdragon, I conclude it takes 4 mig-21 to destroy a mig-23

#### ender dragon is nanjolno

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759846634702217398

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759853352958009614

Lise (nanjolno character) and Jean (name of the ender dragon) have the same etymology as both mean "God is gracious" and so is lise because satisfaction is grace.

Lise's last name hohenstien means "high rock". When the ender dragon dies. the portal spawns on the highest part of the end island at 0,0 (source:  https://youtu.be/B4WX1Ia75cs?t=18 ). Even during earlier versions, The portal spawns where the dragon is which is most likely flying and flying is done high up. The dragon egg spawns on the highest [rock] bedrock block on it. The word high appears 3 times.



#### silverfish etymology

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759850532238180587

I tried thinking of a way to connect silverfish to veitname war, just like how I connected beds, enderdragon, bat, and phantoms to the veitnam war in my 2023 minecraft theory.


#### chrous fruits which I would connect to the reason why it is called eyes of ender

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759862425904411052
source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759863330489991461

I mention that chorus fruit only teleport where steve looks, hoping the connect it to eyes of ender. Then I decide that writting about chorus fruits being named after sound was more important. Chorus fruits are just a attempt for ender crystals to tell endermen that their real name is "tears in force" (a lyrics from white forces-fripside)

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759864689780023323

I struggled to theorize about shulkers until april 6, 2024 which you can find in my minecraft theory new.md and went back to theorizing eyes.

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1759865423321858199

eyes are so important in teleportation that not only chorus fruits and eyes of ender are related, but also endermen can only detect steve if steve looks at him.

I updated the list of what lise hohenstien became to include chorus fruits and pigs. The exact verse I cited from 1983 schwarzesmarken is "君との約束が 絆を強く結び\nいくつもの未来に響いていく結末"

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1760212981864935562

Then a updated list of what lise hohenstien made


#### formation of outer end islands

source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1760115845210996893
source: https://twitter.com/DoNutDecember/status/1760116468023263600

Context (from my minecraft theory 2023): The end exist due to the strategic placement of bedrock which acts as a portal frame [such that the portal teleports all the end islands onto itself over and over again, which prevents the void from teleporting the end islands into the singularity]

Outer end islands already existed in minecraft ever the main island existed. When the ender dragon died in the early versions the exit portal depends on where the ender dragon died. Then in later versions of minecraft, the exit portal is always at 0,0 which is the correct placement to create a portal around the main island which teleports everything leaving the main island to the outer islands. Since in the later version, the exit portal is placed even when the ender dragon is alive, steve can skip the end fight and go to the outer islands.
