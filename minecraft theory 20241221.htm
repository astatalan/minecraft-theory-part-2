## incompatible</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
In the beginning there was a neutron star in the universe which is
the surface of a hypersphere. The beams were bent by the hypersphere
to create a fake sun and moon back on the surface of the neutron
star. The beams were different because of wave interference with each
other. The moon light is mostly made of high frequency light, so it
is able to penetrate and give everything properties within 256 blocks
of ordinary matter. The sunlight is mostly made of infrared, visible
and ultraviolet light, which is much less penetrating. However, the
magnetic field from the neutron star blocking the radiation is still
so strong that almost nothing can detect the day and night cycle. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The universe starts to expand while being steady state for the
neutron star. This made the neutron star bigger really fast. The
neutron star collapse creating a singularity in the middle. It left 2
outer shells of neutronium behind. The 2 shells interacted with
modified gravity to stay the gravitationally stable. Since modified
gravity does not follow newton's shell theorum, the inner shell split
into a lower shell and a middle shell due to different gravitation
interaction with the upper shell. The lower and middle shell was the
nether and the upper shell was the overworld. The nether was filled
with holes because of the gravitational reaction while the overworld
had no holes. The universe is still expanding which alters the wave
interference between the sunlight and moonlight causing the moon
cycle.  The magnetic field is still blocking most of the light
because of light lag. The magnetic field gives out its own radiation
which is like sunlight but harmless.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Because everything else did not expand with accordance to its own
energy density, the neutron star became the largest object in the
universe pulling everything including intelligent life from far away
towards it. Any matter that wish to survive without falling into the
singularity would have to be able to teleport on to the surface of
the 3 shells of neutronium. The first creatures to inhabit the
minecraft world were endermen. It was because they were able to
survive the fall down from the event horizon to the overworld by
teleportation. All other items that fell through were going so fast,
that their radiation length were really long. This means that they
reacted very little when they fall through. The light that beams down
from the sky were so blue shifted that they produced matter pairs
which could interact with the world's magnetic field.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
After landing on the overworld, the endermen used nether reactor core
to teleport to the nether. The nether had almost nothing but some
pieces of neutronium. Some endermen drop down the nether with
neutronium to place it randomly. A few pieces were placed in the
correct spot to form the main end island. There was a place
(different from the main end island) in the internether void where
endermen could teleport over and over again to the same spot making
it seem that they have anti-gravity. The endermen use teleportation
to pull matter from the singularity. Because of the no hair theorem,
the matter is always the same being endstone. The endermen and the
endstone made up the outer end islands. Outer was only in perspective
of the main end islands only after the main end island connects to
it. There were no radial gaps in the outer end islands and there were
no center.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Void is a pun. All portals teleport to the singularity. They just
differ in the where it is teleported out of the singularity. Since
the output is the same place as input then it is void because default
answer is the same place. This also makes end island also a void
portal since the definition of default changed from the place of
transportation to the place of the original portal. The default place
could also mean staying in the singularity which means that the
object is destroyed. The void portals lit by bedrock and lava would
produce a portal that does just that.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Because the speed of light is finite, the neutron star's magnetic
field was still strong. It blocks the matter pairs that were produced
from light. The magnetic field was so strong that it produced an
aurora that outshines all the light in the sky. Therefore, the sky
looks like it was always sunny. Since the magnetic field blocks the
particles, none of the particles would affect like the day and night
cycle.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
As the time passed, the neutronium decayed into bedrock. The bedrock
decayed into stone in the overworld and netherrack in the end. The
endermen made glassware and quartz from the stone. Endermen were able
to use glassware to observe the stars through the blinding aurora.
The most important discovery that the endermen made were about noble
gases. Like in real life, the process were all the same except for
helium because there are no petroleum reserves in minecraft. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The starlight that was observed by endermen was still the same light
that was close to the nuetron star right before the steady state
expansion. The minecraft crust used antigravity to prevent the
starlight that was close to neutron star surface from blueshifting.
But the antigravity only fully reverses the light's blueshift, if it
originated close to the surface.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Helium that was observed by the endermen has an average mass of 3 in
minecraft. The endermen named helium as helion because it followed
the -on ending for noble gases. (helion in english means a helium
isotope that weighs 3) Helion was observed on the ground only as a
decay product of tritium, but it was only observed in the stars. The
sky was always bright. (helium in english means "sun") The
endermen think of bright things as closer to holy than the dark
things, so the endermen thought the stars were holy. Some endermen
think the stars are angels hanging around above the transparent
firmament. Endermen conclude that tritium and helion were the same
element because the mass was the same. Endermen name tritium to
something similar to trinity because it was glowing and can make
glowing water. Since tritium was really rare, endermen never were
able to collect much of it. Endermen thought if they get a bulk
amount of helium, they would be able to make something powerful like
an angel. Endermen believed in fusion, but it was from hydrogen to
deuterium to tritium, and elements with mass of 4 to 6 were skipped.
Endermen named deuterium because when endermen first discovered it,
they didn't realize that it was diatomic. So endermen measured a
value of 4 which the endermen named it after the 4th book of the
bible.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Neon in minecraft has an average mass of 21. It was first discovered
in the atmosphere. (neon in english means "new") After it
was already named, the endermen discovered it in supernova and in the
stars before they went supernova. Since the endermen forgot why neon
was named neon, the endermen thought neon means that it was a new
star forming instead of a star dying. Because the neutron star
remnant is more positive in absolute brightness, it was actually a
star disappearing from the endermen's view. Neonite was impossible to
exist because all elements with 20-22 mass other than neon are very
radioactive. Sometimes, the endermen observed a star with large
amounts of neon which was much more proportions than even supernovas.
The endermen believed that it was an important stars because neon was
the element of new. They observed that the star also had lots of
oxygen and another element, that the endermen say "OMG".
Because oxygen was already named as O, the endermen named the new
element symbol as mg. Endermen didn't known whether or not the nuclei
weighed the same as neon, but the name "neonite" caught on
regardless.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Argon has an average mass of 36 on the minecraft world, but it has an
average mass of 40 in minecraft. Argon was also discovered in
supernova, but not as much. It wasn't named yet. The argon in
supernova remnant was discovered to weigh 36, but on the minecraft
world, it weighed 40. The endermen thought it was just 2 different
elements. The endermen decided that the reason for the similarity in
emission spectrum was because the elements were so inert that it was
hard to tell the difference using chemical reactions, so it was named
as inert. (argon in english means "inert") Many endermen
believed that the existence of 2 different inert elements is a God
given analogy which shows that even the most righteous, pure, clean,
holy, .... earthly thing is no match for the righteous, pure, clean,
holy, .... thing in heaven. The worldly argon weighs 40 which is not
as interesting as the number 36. "Jesus fasted for 40 days, but
in heaven, he would have fasted for 3 consecutive periods of 12 days"
the endermen reasoned. Although the endermen did known about
potassium, the endermen didn't know of a argonite because the
potassium-40 was too rare to discover. (most argon-40 comes from
potassium-40 decay) Potassium's molecular mass was measured to be 39.
Coincidentally, the endermen named argon-40 as Kalium with a symbol
of K. (kalium is an old name for potassium and K is the symbol for
potassium) K in reference to krypton and kryptonite which one type is
in space, but the other on the minecraft world. Kalium was used as a
named to make a reference to calcium which is the element kryptonite
is known to replace. Even more coincidental is that calcium has a
stable isobar at 40. The endermen refused to name argon-40 as
argonite because the -ite ending is reserved for naming an allotroph.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Krypton and strontium both have an average mass of 84 in minecraft.
Krypton was also discovered in supernova, but was not discovered
before the star went supernova. Low mass stars are too dim for the
endermen to detect. The endermen named it as if it was hidden inside
the star before it went supernova, so they named it as krypton.
(krypton in english means "hidden")</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Strontium weighed the same as krypton, but was not discovered in the
sky because low mass stars are too dim to see with telescope. The
endermen thought strontium was a different type of krypton. The
spectrum was different, but the endermen reasoned it was just
different allotrophes. So, the endermen called strontium as
kryptonite. (kryptonite in english means "something that makes
superman weak") The ending part of the word to reference that
the type of krypton was solid. The endermen observed that when they
eat kryptonite, their brains work slower and they became weaker.
Kryptonite replaces calcium in neurons and muscle fibers. Since
kryptonite has a higher molecular mass than calcium, it moves slower
which slows the recharge rate of neurons and muscle fibers.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Calcium-40 and titanium-48 are no longer stable and scandium-44 is
stable. It decays quickly to potassium-40 which then takes billions
of years to decay to argon. However, it would do it much quicker at
high pressures because of electron capture. Alpha process no longer
produce calcium-44 because scandium-44 ends the decay chain
prematurely. The most abundant form of calcium is calcium-48. The
endermen think that 48 is a reference to 84 that tells them to intake
kryptonite. Because calcium-48 has so many neutrons, it is no longer
the least dense alkaline earth metal. Neonite is the least dense
alkali metal and of all metals.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Lithium weighed 7 in minecraft. Like kryptonite, the endermen could
only find it on earth. Unlike kryptonite, the endermen believed that
lithium was a completely new element. Many endermen liked lithium
because it calms them down and that 7 is a holy number. Endermen
believed the calming experience is the effect of connecting to a
higher reality. In fact it really is because the more you wither from
lithium poisoning, the closer you are to heaven. Doubly in fact, the
angel that would deliver the lithium to you is the angel that is
fallen from heaven.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Carbon had an average weight of 12 which had the same color as
endermen's skin. Endermen really liked their skin color because 12 is
a holy number</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Xenon had an average weight of 127. Xenon was only discovered in
supernova that came from neutron stars which the endermen called
"blinking stars". The endermen thought the blinking stars
are strange. And that out of all the elements found on the minecraft
world, only xenon was discovered to be nowhere other than from
blinking stars which was also strange. So, it was named as strange.
(xenon in english means "strange") Although xenon was never
isolated in minecraft due to endermen's technological limitation, the
endermen believed that they still have xenon. It was actually iodine.
The spectrum were a little different but it was still purple.
Endermen dismiss the inconsistency thinking that xenon was just a
strange element. Endermen never named a xenonite because the endermen
thought that both the worldly xenon and celestial xenon had the same
chemical properties other than spectrum.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Iron was already named, but the endermen did not know why it was
named that. (iron in english means "holy") When the
endermen discovered the supernova, they found so much nickel which
was an element that is never discovered on the minecraft world. The
nickel had a half-life of 6 days which decays to cobalt that had 77
days of half-life until it turns into iron. (both nickel and cobalt
in english means "devil") The endermen concludes that since
iron is holy, then nickel and cobalt also relates. They were 3
elements which made the endermen think that it is like the trinity as
in the 3 crosses. So the endermen named the 2 other metals as nickel
and cobalt because the 2 others on the cross were not Jesus. Another
reason why the endermen thought they were related to Jesus was that
on average, nickel decayed on the 7th day, and then stay as cobalt
for 11 periods of 7 days, and then finally turn into iron. In total,
there were 12 periods of 7 days. 1 as nickel which represent the
criminal on the cross that criticized Jesus. the endermen compared
him to Judas just like there were 1 Judas and 11 other disciples.
Because Judas sold Jesus for money, nickel's symbol was the smile
instead of the star. (nickel sounds like nico yazawa which has the
symbol of a smile) The smile represents the obverse on the coin.
Stable nickel from the alpha process was observed to be mass of 60.
The endermen believed that stable nickel was a different element than
nickel. It was just trying disguise itself like iron just like Judas
being a fake disciple, according to the endermen. The endermen could
not observe the zinc's decay chain because the half-life was so
small. The endermen concluded that 60 represents the number of smiles
on 30 shekels of silver. Each shekel had a smile on each side
(instead of only on the obverse side) because the shekels were extra
greedy. Endermen collected lots of data. It took a lot of data to
determine the molecular mass of elements that make small proportions
of the supernova remnant. One of the elements was manganese. It had a
mass of 55 which was so close to 56 which made the endermen say "OMG"
so the endermen named it after mg. It wasn't named after om because
that was not an existing element that the endermen named.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Endermen considered there to be 7 sacred elements. The first is iron
which is due to its own name. The next 3 are helium, lithium, and
carbon because they correspond to 3, 7, and 12. The endermen believed
that the 3 numbers are the most holy of all numbers because endermen
are christians. The next 3 are neon, argon, and krypton because they
correspond to products of 3, 7, and 12 which are 21, 36, and 84.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
As endermen practiced their new beliefs, the endermen stopped leaving
skeletons when they died. This is because that kryptonite replaces
the calcium in their bones. Kryptonite is a bigger ion which makes it
more water soluble which causes the skeleton to decay too quickly.
Endermen stored their dead in the nether because nether was spacious
without many important stuff. The kryptonite (which leaked out of
decaying endermen skeletons) combined with aluminum oxide and
europium to make glowstone which makes clumps of glowstone everywhere
in the nether. (glowstone glows green in real life like kryptonite in
superman movies) Europium doesn't glow by itself, so the endermen who
believed in God but not Jesus were named after them. (еврейский
and европий<span lang="ru-RU"> </span>are similar in
pronunciation <span lang="ru-RU">по-руский</span>) Glowstone
glows by absorbing uv light. The uv light comes from high energy
neutrinos collisions.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Endermen had all the same color eyes which were green, but they
differ in color when their eyes blinked. The endermen debated what
color the eye blinks should be. Some endermen believed that it should
be red because the emission spectrum of lithium is red, and 7 and 12
are numbers that are alike which 7 corresponds to lithium and 12
corresponds to carbon. However some endermen believe that a blink is
best expressed with xenon because xenon is the element from the
blinking star. Another reason to choose xenon was that it had both 7
and 12 as digits of the atomic mass. Xenon was more convincing that
lithium, so the endermen use eugenics to make their eye blinks to be
purple color. Iodine which the endermen called 'worldly xenon' was a
bit pinkish. Xenon was a bit bluish. The endermen choose the average
which was a deep purple. Since the endermen picked iodine and xenon
as the color of their blinks, endermen gave iodine and xenon the
symbol of an eye. (in english, the letter 'I' that is used as the
symbol for iodine is pronounced the same as eye) In order to enforce
the eugenics program, when an endermen look at another endermen, they
had to blink. Blinking shows that the endermen has purple blinks. If
the endermen or thing that looks like an endermen (this includes the
player) does not blink purple, the endermen would get made and
attack.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Endermen lived long and fullfilling lives. As the time went on, more
stone was used. Some stones had more dead endermen than others. The
endermen flesh decayed into the stone which gave it properties like
soul sand. Endermen flesh were everywhere, so even the small stones
in the overworld floated on water.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Chromium doesn't have any part in the minecraft theory other than
being a byproduct of the alpha process. Calcium-53 has 20 protons
(age of me in year 114) and 33 neutrons (age of sumipe in year 114).
Calcium-53 decays into chromium-53. One reason why the endermen may
have named it chromium was that they discovered 2 elements (isobars)
with the same emission spectrum, so they named it based on color.
Back in feburary 11, 2024, I wrote on twitter comparing chromium to
marriage. The reason was that chromium to me means something hard, so
I thought hard means diamond which is diamond ring. I had overlooked
the fact that chromium is what gives rubies their color, and rubies
were the symbol of marriage rings before diamonds replaced them
because of advertisements. How to find if you and your partner of
compatible? Take the smaller age and that is the number of protons,
then take the larger age and that is the number of neutrons, see if
the atom decays into chromium. Another reason why sumipe should marry
me is that rubies are also made of aluminum and aluminum's symbol is
al which rubies are transparent and transparent aluminum is alon
which sounds like Alan which is my name. Wait, in the year 114, I
would turn 21 before sumipe turn 34. And that also decays into
chromium. Even worse is that its mass is twice of aluminum which mean
that it may be a even more 2 weeks. 2 times a aluminum nuclei is
iron-54 which is the only iron isobar that has the same isobar as
chromium. In my twitter I wrote that iron decaying into chromium is
analogy that marriage is only half-way. However a counter argument is
that 20 and 33 can concatenate to 2033 which is in the near future.
Another thing that can cause another 2 weeks is that in the year 114,
sumipe will turn 34 like in rule 34. Another thing is that
scandium-55 decays into both chromium and manganese. Manganese as in
it is the average of chromium-54 and iron-56 which means that both
marriage and marriage which means more 2 weeks.</p>

## 0.0.1.14</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
First version which is compatible with my minecraft theory because
0.0.1.14 and 0.0.1.15 are very similar. Some of the stone are iron
ore, coal ore, or gold ore. The stone decayed into gravel and then to
sand which then decayed into dirt and grass blocks. Trees grew on the
grass blocks. The endermen lived in Rainforest, Seasonal forest, Ice
desert, and Shrubland, so the player never sees them. Dead endermen
combined with sand to turn into soul sand.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Endermen discovered that nitrogen was 2 different masses. One is 14
and a smaller portion is 15. The endermen Decides to name them light
nitrogen and heavy nitrogen. Since nitrogen was already thought of
being 14, the light nitrogen's name did not change. Heavy nitrogen
was given the symbol of Nh. Endermen believed nitrogen is like
lithium. They were accidentally right because nitrogen is the 7th
element and lithium weighed 7. Nitrogen asphyxiation was harder to
detect. When there is too much nitrogen, not only would you get the
same numbing effect like lithium and wither, but also you wouldn't
know that you were drowning, so the bubbles were whited out on the
player ui.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The endermen could not agree on which type of copper to call copper.
Copper was discovered to be a weight of 64 and was given a symbol of
Cu. Then copper was isolated to light copper and heavy copper. Light
copper was a little more abundant than heavy copper by 69/31.
Endermen couldn't decide what the element symbols should be. Cu is
already 2 letters, so they cannot just add another symbol. Some
endermen found that the square root of 64 is 8 and 8th mv in fripside
infinite clips is sister's noise. The sisters referenced in the song
both had copper colored hair. The younger sister had a slightly
lighter color hair than the older sister. Light copper and heavy
copper are like sisters. Cube root is 4 and 4th mv has 2 girls and
the one that is not nanjolno has copper colored hair. 2 is the 6th
root and in the 2nd mv, Nanjou Yoshino has copper colored hair. Some
endermen believed that light copper's symbol should be Sk which
stands for Shirai Kuroko and heavy copper's symbol should be Mm which
stands for Misaka Mikoto. The endermen believed that the size of the
characters should correspond to the weight of the element. Other
endermen pointed out that Misaka Mikoto had 20000 clones and that the
number of characters should correspond to the abundance of the
elements. The copper ore didn't exist because it was still debated
which copper should it be. The split of 69/31 caused 69 to be a
symbol of sex because Shirai Kuroko is gay with Misaka Mikoto.
Furthermore, Shirai Kuroko is the more gay character which
corresponds to the element with abundance 69. The endermen made candy
named after sk which is skittles.  The hard, sweet, and addictiveness
is like gluciuum and lithium. The endermen wanted to be like lithium
and gluciuum because 7 times 9 is 63. M 'n m are named after Mm. The
endermen thought element with mass of 13 would be something like
carbon, so the endermen made it look black. And 5 might be no stable
nuclei but pleasant like "heaven is a place on earth". So
the M 'n m is designed to be black and melts quickly.</p>

Before an endermen died, he thought that life was so nice that he
would always cherish the memories in heaven. Every endermen on his
deathbed would talk about how grateful he was in life and it just
keeps going on. The endermen's children would think that heaven would
be much more better than life on the minecraft world. The endermens'
souls ascended. The endermen was too right, heaven was too good. The
endermens' souls couldn't believe that they were tricked to continue
living a life so much worse than what they could have lived in
heaven. Nostalgia for their children faded away. The endermen wanted
to avenge for the time that they lost form not going to heaven
earlier. But first, they are just souls in soul sand and need a
weapon. They choose the alloy with the most specific strength. It was
lithium magnesium (endermen called magnesium as neonite) alloy, and
by weight, it was stronger than any nitinol, high entropy alloy,
steel, titanium alloy, aluminium-scandium alloy, maraging steel,
ferroalloy, tungsten alloy and others. The high lithium content made
it less dense than water. The magnesium content was just high enough
to not react with water and be stiff. The armour was perfected with
the exception of isotope separation. It could have weighed a little
less if it was made from lithium-6 and magnesium-24 instead of
lithium-7 and magnesium-25. The wither skulls were also made of
lithium. When it hits, the skull explodes spreading lithium dust. The
dust is hygroscopic and get absorbed into the blood after displacing
hydrogen. The lithium calms and numbs the victim preventing the
victim from knowing how much damage they took only able to know that
they are taking damage. The displacement of hydrogen causes damage
like poison. Blue skulls were blue because they contain magic that
irradiates UV catastrophe. Massive numbers of endermen souls gathered
around ready to reenter minecraft. The endermen souls knew that the
wither cannot teleport or even teleport to the same place because the
temptation to return to heaven is so strong that all the
teleportation would be redirected back into heaven. Since there were
few soul sand in the overworld, no withers were able to spawn there.
The withers spawned all at once evenly distributed in every chunk of
the nether. They quickly defeated all the endermen civilization in
the nether. They flew out through the top holes going to the
overworld. They tried to destroy the bedrock but it was only enough
damage to imprint their face into each block of bedrock.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
After all the withers left to attack the overworld, the endermen were
safely able to go back to the nether. The endermen concluded that it
was the burial practices that made the withers. Endermen cleaned up
the mess in the nether and piled the soul sand in clumps so that any
new wither attacks would be localized. The endermen trained
themselves to bury themselves into ender pearls. The endermen didn't
like water because it causes them to decay a bit, and the endermen
think that it might cause more soul sand to form. The endermen
designed the ender pearl to trap the souls which also traps the souls
from going to heaven. All endermen that turned into enderpearls would
live in boredom because they were forever stuck in the same place.
Ender pearls cannot blink because they are already dead, so the eye
of ender are always greenish-blue, and ender pearls are darker on the
inside. The blue from the ender pearl and eye of ender is from the uv
catastrophe radiation. Since souls and stuff are magic, they are not
quantum which causes them to emit uv catastrophe. Since no more
endermen bury themselves outside of the enderpearl, no more soul sand
were created. The sand and gravel in the overworld began to pure from
the souls. They became less like soul sand and were able to sink in
water and lava.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The endermen looked up into the nether-overworld void. They saw it
was bright. They measured the emission spectrum and it matched
lithium and neonite. The endermen interpreted it as a sign of a 2nd
heaven existing in between the overworld and nether. So, the endermen
named the minecraft world on top as overworld. The name means that it
was over something. The 2nd heaven was interpreted as something much
more significant than the 1st heaven. The lithium which was suppose
to only be found on the ground was interpreted as endermen on the
ground can even ascend to heaven. The neonite was interpreted as
something that is new. Therefore, it should be named the 2nd heaven.
The endermen labeled it as an achievement but with a question mark.
It is like a happening but more like a sign. The achievement was
called "Beginning?"</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Some withers died from friendly fire and dropped wither stars. The
wither stars contained lithium and neonite. This proved that it was
infact lithium and neonite. So the endermen made the achievement to
be about a happening which was "Beginning." The endermen
were able to measure the molecular mass of neonite for the 1st time.
It was 25. Since the mass of neonite, 25, is different than the mass
of neon, 21, it was supposed to be renamed, but the name had stayed
for too long for the endermen to want to change it. The endermen also
found that the item could not teleport or else it disappears. The
endermen thought that it was like a star because stars get eaten by
singularities and teleportation goes through singularities. So the
endermen called it as nether star. There were still some withers
around the bedrock surface of the nether, so the endermen were not
able to reach far up toward the 2nd heaven. Endermen decided to name
the 2nd heaven. They named it as "eastern capital". East
was used because east means new sun. New describes both the light and
neonite. They use japanese so it is <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京</span></font></font>.
The weight of 25 made endermen like the name for the element weighing
55. The endermen know that 5(5) is Mg and 55 is Mn. A coincidence
that endermen could not discover is that Magnesium has a weight of 25
and the 25th element is Manganese. Endermen did give neonite a
scientific name which is derived from "my God" part of OMG.
God is great and great in latin is magnus, so the endermen named it
as magnesium. Since magnesium is connected to God, lithium-magnesium
alloy means that God is returning to earth. Which is a big happening.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The endermen mix the nether star with oxygen, silicon, and iron
because they thought the 3 inner layers of a star that is about to
become a supernova to be holy. It makes a beacon. The beacon's side
that face the iron core was made of obsidian because it has more iron
than glass. The beacon was put on a pile of iron and it emit a beam.</p>

The heat produced from the endless barrage of wither skull began to
lit a void between the overworld and nether which then began to lit
the a void below the nether. The bedrock and space between the nether
and overworld and below the overworld was turned into lava as an
intermediate step to creating the void. All the withers disappeared
because they cannot survive teleportation. It all happened on July
22. The endermen reasoned that July meaning 7 which is the lithium.
22 is the day after 21 which 21 is neon. Therefore, the date that it
happened means that it was after neon. 22 is not associated with a
mass of any element. However 23 is just like 24 is between 2 elements
and is the version number. It was such a sad day to see <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京

released a album " <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京

</span></font></font>described the stars in  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京
</span></font></font>because it is starlight and twilight is when it
is not sunny nor black like the night sky.  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">きみを探しに
</span></font></font>is what the endermen does when  <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">東京
</span></font></font>turned into lava. A special song was named from
the mass of lithium and neonite to mourn the loss. It was named
"7<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">月</span></font></font>25<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">日</span></font></font>".
Infact, if you defeat a wither above the build height limit, you get
a disk containing 7<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">月</span></font></font>25<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">日</span></font></font>,
but it doesn't work because the song is copyrighted. The lyrics was
like "dog died and get 2 cats". The endermen mourned as if
their dog died. The endermen were angry. "It must be element
22's fault" they thought because it happened on july 22. Then a
white floating cube in the overworld was making cat sounds. It
appeared on the same day, so endermen believed that the ghast was the
culprit. The endermen thought "it must be made of element 22"
They were accidentally correct. The ghast was white like titanium
dioxide. The endermen thought "if the ghast stayed in the
overworld, the ghast would cause the overworld sky to turn into
lava". It was also the 15th year of the millennial when the
events happened, the endermen interpret it as an element weighing 15
which is heavy nitrogen which also starts with N. Since heavy
nitrogen is so connected to the japanese stuff, the endermen decides
to change the name to be like japan. The name nihonium was chosen
because it is named after nihon. A coincidence that was created
because it happened on the 15th year was that in the 15th mv, the
lyrics described a grey sky. The grey sky is the bedrock sky in the
nether. One coincidence that the endermen couldn't know about is that
14 and 15 are the mass of the 7th element (because endermen count
elements by mass and not protons) and 14th and 15th mv of fripside
infinite clips are in fripside's 12th single. It was also pi day and
pi is circle which means Judas's religion, and coins are very
circular too. The endermen decides to personify the day. They need to
name it from a person that means smile in japanese and the last name
needs to contain <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">澤
</span></font></font>(the endermen always chant "drain the
swamp" when something bad happens), so they choose <font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">矢澤にこ
</span></font></font>as the name. Sand and gravel lose more soul sand
properties, so they absorb the liquid when they stop falling. Pigs
evolved. Many endermen thought, maybe it will stop on july 25th.
After july 25 passed and nothing happened, many endermen thought it
will stop next year as a reference to fortuna on the sixteenth night.</p>

Moss evolved. Player learned how to make iron block. In the
ionosphere, matter-antimatter pairs were trapped. Muons catalyzed
fusion. Lithium, gluciuum, and boron were destroyed quickly when
formed. As the magnetic field weakened because the magnetic neutrons
became too far in space time, the particles suspended in the
minecraft ionosphere began to fall down. Most particles were
hydrogen. CNO cycle prevented elements heavier than oxygen from
forming. Hydrogen, Helium, methane, and nitrogen floated up, so the
only things that fall down was water. Rain happened for the first
time. The endermen believed that it was because the ghast was causing
rain to not happen because rain is opposite of lava. The endermen
kept the ghast in the nether because they believed bringing the ghast
back would stop the rain and eventually cause the sky to turn into
lava.</p>

Oxygen concentrations in atmosphere grew to over 15 percent due to
the rain being a source of oxygen as water. The concentration means
fire can exist on typical flammable stuff. The torch is able to stay
lite forever. It deposit carbon in itself by reducing carbon monoxide
in air. It burns both carbon in the torch and carbon monoxide in the
air. The net reaction is burning carbon monoxide in the air which

Gears are able to rotate forever because it is made of antimatter
which slowly reacts with matter to turn into energy. The gears were
made air proof enough to resist annihilation from red matter. The
player finally gets their hand on it. The outside of the gears are
made of the same thing as red stone ore. It is so that the red matter
inside gets attracted to the outside.

Humaniods evolved. They are steve, black steve, beast boy, and alice.
Antimatter was needed to make small components which makes smart
brains. Antimatter reacted slow enough to not detonate. Strange
matter is the same as red matter. Strange matter was multiplying by
touching normal matter. The strange matter starts destroying humaniod
brains by turning them into micro blackholes. Humaniods became
dumber. 
</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Some humanoids tried to protect themselves by using immune system.
They are called volatile humanoids. The immune system had to use
chemicals that are more and more volatile. The volatile substances
became explosive. In order to prevent the humanoid from accidentally
exploding, the humanoid made 2 sacs for the volatiles. 1 sac is
smaller and contained very sensitive but not powerful explosive.
Another sac contained very powerful but not sensitive explosive. The
sensitive explosive is much better at complexing the strange matter.
The powerful explosive was very safe to store in large quantities.
Since it is powerful it means that it is energy dense, so it can make
multiple times the amount of the sensitive explosive. Sometimes there
is lots of red matter around, so the humanoid evolved to be made of
erectile tissue, so that the sensitive explosives can cycle many
times very fast over a really large surface area to complex any red
matter. The erectile tissue moves air instead of liquids because
liquids are heavy and biologically expensive. This makes a hissing
sound when the air is moved through small holes.  The erectile tissue
evolves to allow the sensitive explosive sac to cover the internal
organs which shortens the distance between the sac and the place of
irritation. This had a side effect of turning the sensitive explosive
sac into a implosive bomb which can pressurize the insides above
autoignition pressure. Eventually the red matter won and there is
nothing but a stupid brain. The mob is now a creeper. The side effect
became the main effect. When the creeper wants to explode, the
creeper stops to get all its muscle to work for a erections. Then a
hissing sound is made from the implosive sac traveling through air
filled tissue. The implosive sac gets around the secondary explosive
sac which needs the implosive sac to ignite. Some of the volatile
humanoid do not use lots of air and erections to get rid of red
matter. Getting rid of red matter with air and stuff is messy and the
red matter can turn from complexed to inorganic and come back to
destroy more. So the humaniod evolved to excrete waste that contains
complexed red matter into sticky white substances. It is designed to
stick and remain that way for a long time. The white sticky substance
decays slower in closed environments, so the spider evolved to have
lots of eyes to see in the dark. White sticky substances can be
disturbed when there are lots of others around, so the spider becomes
aggressive when there is no light. There isn't an evolutionary
advantage to be aggressive outside because the white sticky substance
would be quickly decaying no matter how many are around. The white
sticky substance evolved to be comfy cobwebs because the more
comfortable, the less likely it would be thrown out to decay into
inorganic red matter. The spider evolved to not fill their room with
waste so fast. So the spider becomes smaller. smaller means smaller
strides. To make up for the loss, the spider evolved legs. There
might be artificial lighting in the spider's room. To get a better
way to tell the difference between inside and outside, the spider
evolved a black body to detect thermal radiation that the sun emits.
Unlike what others may theorize, the reason why spiders are neutral
during the day is not because the spiders are blinded by the
sunlight.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Some humanoids used another way to get rid of red matter. They are
called undead humanoids. The humaniods became undead because undead
means that some effects do the opposite effect. But red matter got
stronger and the undeadness could not make the red matter do the
opposite effect. The humaniod lost its brain and became a zombie.
Some undead humanoids can use their undeadness to negate hunger. The
undead humaniods then evolved to close off points of failure. Closing
off also eliminated lots of flesh because flesh absorbs things. The 
undead humaniods still lose the brains because the red matter was
getting so strong, and they became skeletons.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The immune system complexes stuff using thiols. The thiol would react
with a metal ion and trap the metal ion inside. The exploding
humanoids evolved to produce different kinds of sulfur compounds. The
endermen really like to make one type which was DMSO. The DMSO would
be in gunpowder. When DMSO is added to potions, the potion is able to
be absorbed through skin.</p>

Gluciuum deposits start to form because a long time has passed. The
gluciuum is in emerald ore. Because the endermen like to eat sweet
stuff, the endermen drilled for them. They drilled so fast that their
diamond drills broke and the diamond drills get left behind and
formed diamond ore in place of the emerald ore.</p>

The ghast had the song "white forces" in its head on
repeat. It had a thin skin that protects the red matter from it's
inside which was made of lots of antimatter. The legs are thrusters
that use antimatter annhiliation to thrust upward. It forms fireball
from air. When the ghast is punctured, the red matter goes inside
really fast, which makes all the antimatter disappear. Then only
thing left is the rest of the skin which forms the ghast tear. Ghasts
don't actually make tears. Ghast gets rid of waste by shooting them
out as fireballs. Ghasts are born very quickly that is why there are
gill shaped belly buttons on them. Ghasts have 2 parents but no
genders and reproduce by sporangia. The 2 ghast hyphae touches and
make the sporangia. The sporangia grows into a baby ghast that
detaches leaving 2 belly buttons. Ghasts like to spawn around soul
sand with the same reason why nether wart likes to spawn there too.
Some ghast once wanted to do what the lyrics is in white forces.

tells the ghasts that the enemy is frozen, so the new weapon should
be firey. The ghasts decided to create the blaze. In order to use the
weapon, the ghasts turn into spawners. "<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">深淵に潜むその敵を</span></font></font>"
tells the ghasts that the enemy is in the abyass. The ghasts decide
to build high structures and put themselves on top of it. This would
counter any frozen enemy down there. "<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">切なさも胸の痛みも全て秘めた勇気に変え</span></font></font>"
tells the ghasts that the insides of the blazes should be able to
turn into strength, so the ghasts made it possible to make strength
potions from blaze powder. Powder meaning that it is heartache that
is turned into strength. "<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">正しさを守り抜くと決意したあの日があるから</span></font></font>"

tells the ghasts about what the blaze spawner looked like. The ghast
thinks that black sentence was jail sentence because the ghasts are
americans. The ghasts believed that wrapped in strength means that
the blaze rods orbit around the center. Echoing means repeating, so
the blazes are built like the center of the blaze spawner is. A way
to see how popular this theory is is to ask ChatGPT to write a song
titled "tears in force" to see if it references minecraft.

blaze and ghast tear is possible. If there are 2, then it means
betrayal from the other.

"<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">心の壁壊さない勇気を私にまた運んだ</span></font></font>"
tells the ghast that blaze spawners should be able to spawn as long

tells the ghast to design the blaze such that friendly fire can't
happen. "<font face="游明朝"><font size="2" style="font-size: 10pt"><span lang="ja-JP">いま響く黒の宣告生き抜くその先に待っている未来信じて</span></font></font>"
tells the ghast to design the spawner so that it is long lasting. So
some spawners were carried into the overworld so that it is protected
in dungeons. Spawners like the number 200, so they give birth on 200
because spawners are tech in a net so they like technetium which has
a mass of 97, and the room around them are red and the element named
after red is rhodium which has a mass of 103. 97 plus 103 is 200. 97
and 103 are the closest primes to 100. Since blaze powder cannot be
produced in the overworld, the spawners spawned zombies and
skeletons. Skeletons were chosen because they look like and attack
like blazes. Zombies were just flesh version of skeletons. The moss
is placed there to keep out red matter. Nether fortresses were built
in the nether coordinates corresponding to overworld Rainforest,
Seasonal forest, Ice desert, and Shrubland to protect the ghasts from
endermen. The ghasts don't know english so they cannot follow things
listed in the chorus.</p>

Spawners trained neural networks. Slime intelligence never developed.
Slime cells that can act as neurons are more like brain cancer cells
because the slime cells also compete against each other. So,
intelligence cannot develop because the pathway to intelligence is
improbable to get to. Spawners decide to train neural networks.
Because heat in the spawners also destroy neural networks even if the
slime cells themselves can survive the heat, the spawners need to use
blaze powder to save the neural network. So, the first slimes were
actually magma cubes. Some magma cubes went to the overworld which
they turned into slimes because blaze powder cannot be produced

Some endermen were experimenting with ghast tears and blaze powder.
They found it combined really good. It was because that the ghast

which tells them to remember and reunite. The endermen wonder if it
could let them ascend to a higher reality, so they combine the ender
pearl with it and it made a tears in force. The endermen and ender
pearl know english. Infact, the endermen were the ones that
understand the element names in english. The creation of tears in
force cause all other recipes of ghast tears and blaze powder from
existing in order to prevent conflict of interest. The tears in force
knew their owner's name is Lise Hohenstien. Hohenstien means high
stone. and the only thing that meets the requirement was a portal
teleporting itself to itself. It was in the void and made of bedrock.
There were endermen there too because endermen can teleport
interdimensionally. The tears in force went there and each went on
each bedrock. "(Black cross sorting With tears in force."
tells them to create obsidian pillars below them. "Let's fly
together until the dream is visible." tells them to create the
ender dragon which would fly around the same place until their dream
is visible. "I want to be a dark despair Energy" tells the
ender dragon to team up with endermen. "Schwarzesmarken arms
now!" tells the ender dragon to choose the mig-23. Mig-23 is the

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
The ender dragon is made of scandium because the both mig-21 and
mig-23 are made of it. Not only that but the minecraft scandium is
scandium-44 and is not radioactive in minecraft. 21 plus 23 is 44
which is another reason to choose 44. 44th element is ruthenium which
means russia, but only the ender dragon knows that. When endermen
gets hit by the ender dragon, the endermen feels a molecular weight
of 44 which makes them think it is diatomic element 22, and the
endermen gets angry and remember Nico Yazawa's birthday and attack
the ender dragon.  Not related to minecraft theory: Sumipe is 33 and
33 is looks like 44, so that is why Sumipe should marry me. A way
that endermen can convergent derive the name scandium is from the
word "dragon scales". Don't wait for me to turn 22. If
scandium is radioactive in minecraft, then the endermen would think
to cleanse calcium-44 from themselves by eating strontium. The reason
why the red dragon does not exist is because since scandium-44 can be
made from the stellar alpha processes, it outnumbers scandium-45 by
alot. The red dragon would be made of isotopically pure scandium-45
because the 45th element is rhodium which means "red". The
reason why the red dragon is weaker is because heavier isotope means
denser for the same strength which means less specific strength. To
accommodate the same load, scandium-45 would need to raise its
quantity to a power of 45/44 which can be alot if the constants are
large. Scandium comes with aluminum, and al is 13th which is "two
souls-towards the truth-" which there are 2 of a lot of things: 
aluminum and scandium, mig-21 and mig-23, 10 and 21, red and ender,
scandium-44 and scandium-45, Eli Ayase and Yoshino Nanjou, and Jean.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
Why was the ender dragon named "Ender dragon" instead of
"The russian dragon", "Ruth the dragon named Jean",
or "dragon With tears in force" (capitalization in
reference to the chorus of the song "white forces"). It is
because the ender dragon is made of scandium which is the 21st
element, and the 21st mv in fripside infinite clip 2020 is "Edge
of the Universe" which suggest that it is the end. The ender
dragon update is the 10th minecraft beta update. 10th mv is black
bullet which also describes the ender dragon. (already written in the
same document a long time ago) 10 and 21 makes 10/21 which is Eli
Ayase birthday.  If the dragon was named after that, it could be "EA
dragon", "jEAn dragon" (the j and n stands for Yoshino
Nanjou. EA stands for Eli Ayase, Electronic Arts, and Effective
Altruism. Yesterday, vsauce released a video which he said that the j
in Jesus came from a y in ancient languages. The reason why the
dragon egg doesn't hatch is because "jEAn is an eggbeater"
Why is it "Eli Ayase and Yoshino Nanjou" instead of "Eli
Ayase as Yoshino Nanjou"? because both Eli Ayase and Yoshino
Nanjou is (signular tense) the ender dragon), "xopowo

The ender dragon also carries a end exit portal which it lays its
eggs. The dragon eggs teleport to  extreme hill biome because that is
"high stone" like hohenstien. The dragon eggs hatch into
silverfish just like mig-21 is a smaller version of mig-23, and
mig-21 is a fish.</p>

The endermen are experimenting with endermen spawner. The endermen

The endermen knows that their biggest enemy was another endermen.
That is because of politics. The endermen formed cults. Their cults
believed that the leader endermen is the best endermen and a way to
eugenics them was to use a spawner. They built strongholds. The
confusing structures because they know the map but any attacking
endermen does not. To prevent the attacker from ambushing by going
through the wall, the endermen harvest silverfish from places to
build them into the stronghold. Endermen need research so they have

(copied from 2023 version) The wither has 2 modes. When it is over
half health, it is using mending enchantment. When it is below half
health, it is using infinity enchantment. Infinity and mending cannot
be used at the same time. The mending enchantment converts imaginary
kinetic energy to real kinetic energy. On items, real kinetic energy
repairs the item. On the wither, it propels the wither up. When the
wither is below half health, the wither uses infinity enchantment as
an active protection system. When the wither detects an arrow, the
wither uses infinity to produce another arrow that counters the
arrow. The infinity arrow despawns after an elastic collision.
Infinity uses kinetic energy to produce infinity arrows. The infinity
bow works by using kinetic energy from pulling the bow to make an
infinity arrow. Infinity does not work on potion arrows or specter
arrows because it only detects kinetic energy. Mending cannot be used
with infinity because infinity would consume the kinetic energy and
break the bow by producing a bunch of infinity arrows inside the bow.</p>

(copied from 2023 version) Sharpness and Bane of arthropods are not
actually enchantments. However they still use enchanting to get
because without gears, there are no microtechnologies that can change
the mechanical properties to make sharpness or bane of arthropods.
Sharpness makes items sharp by changing the microstructure of the
item and sharpening edges. Bane of arthropods creates microscopic
holes in the item. When an arthropod gets hit, their instinct causes
their bodies to try to infest the item which causes part of the
arthropod to stick on the item as if it was barbed. The arthropod is
slowed down because the arthropod is being pulled by the seemingly
barbed item. The microscopic holes activate the arthropod's instinct
because holes means that the item can be infested. Sharpness cannot
be applied to bane of arthropods because the enchantment would
mistake the holes as edges and bevel the item into oblivion. Bane of
arthropods cannot be applied to sharpness because the enchantment
cannot detect sharp edges and blunt the item and ruin microstructure
because creating the holes cause the lattices to misalign. The result
is an item that would be too brittle to use.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
(copied from 2023 version) Smite is sharpness with dullness
enchantment. It does sharpness damage to undead and the dullness gets
negated to do extra damage. To other mobs, the dullness negates
sharpness and does damage as if it was not enchanted.</p>

(copied from 2023 version) Unbreaking uses quantum mechanics to
increase durability of the things it enchants. The whole item acts
like a few big particles. When the item is under the unbreaking
enchantment, microscopic cracks are harder to form because groups of
particles act like one big particle.</p>

The endermen successfully made the endermen spawner. But, the spawner
was also intelligent. It is like AI in real life but actually
dangerous. The spawner steals the lab rat endermen's abilities and
teleported endstone around it to protect itself. The enderstone is
infinitely regenerating making it indestructible. The endermen put a
blaze powder and enderpearl on it and it got stuck forever. The end
portal frame is trying to make a permanently open portal to the end
in order to get revenge aginst the endermen. The endermen think it
was malicious, so they abandon it. The spawners formed in 13 and
invaded other stronghold by using the endermen's ability to teleport.
The spawners made the end portal room using 13 lava blocks and 13
spawners. The spawners were high up because they are named
"Hohenstien". At least one end portal was opened, so it
made a sound that can be heard anywhere. All the blazes and spawners
listened and knew to use blaze powder that can combine to make eye of
ender.</p>

The melon evolved to be more and more air. The air pockets on the

effect, but the gold foam can easily react with the potion because of
surface area, and give the potion healing effect.</p>

conclude "the first item that the player would get is a the item
dropped when creeper is killed by skeleton. The item should be
something that tells player than the ghast is friendly. So, the ghast
gave music disk to creeper. Creeper promise to only drop it when

Experience is imaginary energy. The player measures the imaginary
speed. Imaginary speed is proportional to the square root imaginary
energy. When the player needs to anvil, the player needs to
accelerate the thing to the same imaginary speed as the other thing.
Because that is the same as a rocket, the rocket equation applies.
Because the anvil is wasteful, the specific impulse is divided by the
natural log of 4 which makes it look like the cost is a power of 2.</p>

enderdragon has heat sensors. The sensors activate from the

Tauons do nuclear reactions preventing strange quarks from touching

numbers of cyclotomic fields because they thought flat with points is
like that. The guardians get the properties of tauism form tauons.
They are very racist so they will attack player. They also live in
the sea because tauonium symbol is the trident. The tauon are very
dense which make them like neutronium. Prismarine is made of matter
with lots of tauons so it shines like the surface of a nuetron star.
It is light blue and fluctuates in brightness. The picobots, that

The enderdragon saw that the red light keeps getting redder until it
is like night. Anticipating something bad to happen the enderdragon
decided to replace its grave at 0,0 , and moved all the pillars in a
circle. The placement is special since it lights a portal in such a
way that it creates invisible portal that connects the main end
island to the rest of the end islands. However there is are radial
gaps thousands of blocks wide because the portal disrupts other
portals that once connects all the outer islands together. Night also

float up and cause destruction. The levitation technology only got as
good as shulker. Another thing that the endermen believed is that if
they levitate a ender pearl enough, they can make the soul in the
pearl go to heaven. Believing that the problem was in the sky, the
endermen invented the starfighter. It was suppose to roam up in the
sky and fight the fictional withers which prevent the nether stars
from raining. However, according to the vietnam war, the starfighter
evolved to be the phantom. But the outer end islands were still
uncontacted from the rest of the minecraft world which prevents the

2nd music video is level5 judgelight. In a different text file, I
have wrote about that 2 connects to level5 because 2-ary logic can do
anything that 5-ary logic can. However 5-ary logic is confusing
because there are lots of different gates that takes 2 input and
return one output and is not easily converted back into 2-ary logic
since 5 is coprime to 2. The version is the 1st version to have code
obfuscation which is like programming in 5-ary logic.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
In the 3rd music video, nanjolno was in a cave. This version of
minecraft adds cave generation. also the title of the music video is
future gazer which  means to gaze into the future. So this version
gazes into the future and skip a couple of numbers</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
0.0.1.9</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
9th music video is eternal reality. The title has reality which means
that you can't really gaze over it because you wouldn't be able to
survive. It is eternal which means long time that contains the
future. It is more realistic because added build mode.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
0.0.1.10</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
10th music video is black bullet. The minecraft version is unplayable
which is like getting hit by a black bullet. There is also a time in
music video where the time pauses like how this version added game
pause. Clockwork planet mv doesn't count as a pause because it is
actually time reverse.</p>

0.0.1.11</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
11th music video is infinite synthesis. The music is named the same
as the albums of phase 2. It is analogous to naming a minecraft
version as minecraft. 0.0.1.11 is named as minecraft because the
version is used to mark anniversaries and is the first public
version. Even more coincidence is that in the mv, there were a wall
of cube blocks, and the main character jumps through them like a
minecraft animation.</p>

0.0.1.12</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
12th music video is Luminize. Luminize like how lava was added to the
version. In the single, there is also unlimited density which is
bedrock.</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
0.0.1.13</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
13th music video is Two souls -towards the truth- which was produced
in Netherlands. Netherlands is known for have land about the same
level as water and smooth terrain generation. In the minecraft
version, terrain generation is fixed to have land not always generate
above water and that the terrain is smoother. Minecraft version also
fix lava mechanics and lava, and netherlands have similar etymology.
It is also the world size test which means land. 113 is named after a
piece of land. And it is also japan which the music is in. Truth is
data. and the minecraft version has level save which means that you
can go towards the truth. Since there is no multiplayer, two souls
means that the single player comes in 2 which is only possible by log
out and log in.</p>

0.0.1.14</p>
<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
14th music video is white forces. In minecraft version, water flows
faster. Fast water is white, so it is white forces. The version adds
gravel, sand, ore, log, and leaves. It is the first version that is
compatible with my minecraft theory because
bedrock→stone→gravel→sand→dirt and ores exist and log→planks.
White forces is in the same album as 15th music video so they share
those similarities. The importance of why it is important to be
compatible to my minecraft theory is that white forces is in anime
which I use to help with my minecraft theory even in 2023 version.</p>

<p style="line-height: 100%; margin-top: 0.04in; margin-bottom: 0.04in">
15th music video is 1983 schwarzesmarken. It is a music in the anime
that I use to theorize minecraft. This version is the 1st version
that is in my minecraft theory since my minecraft theory is only
about multiplayer version of minecraft. 0.0.1.15 is start of
multiplayer test. 115 is element Mc which is abbreviation for
minecraft so that is another reason to start on it. 109 is element Mt
which is abbreviation for multiplayer test. multiplayer test code is
in 1.12 which corresponds to 112 which is the arithmetic mean of 109
and 115. 112 also adds bedrock which is a huge step closer to being
compatible to my minecraft theory. 109 adds building which is like
multiplayer because destroy mode and build mode.
